            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons,</hi> &amp;c. Here are two things conſiderable in the Words; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of them: For the <hi>Form,</hi> it is a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; the <hi>Matter</hi> in it is the Perſon, and a Thing: The <hi>Perſon</hi> is Chriſt, the <hi>Thing</hi> to which this <hi>Perſon</hi> is reſembled, and that is an <hi>Apple-tree;</hi> it's titled by its plantation; <hi>Among the Trees of the Wood:</hi> Then we have the <hi>Application</hi> of this Similitude, in that word, <hi>So is my Beloved among the Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42593:4"/>
            <p>Here is alſo an <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of this ſimilitude in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which diſcovers wherein Chriſt is reſembled to the Apple-tree: Firſt, For the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of it; <hi>I ſat under his ſhadow with great delight.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Furit</hi> of it; <hi>His Fruit was ſweet to my Taſte.</hi> There is ſomething obſervable held forth in the dependance that theſe words have upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: If you look into the ſecond verſe, <hi>As the Lily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Thorns, ſo is my Beloved among the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> In that verſe Chriſt ſets forth the excellency of his Spouſe, declaring the high eſtimation he hath of her; <hi>She is a Lily among the Thorns, ſo is my Love among the Daughters.</hi> By how much the Lily is to be prefer'd before the Thorns and Thiſtles, ſo much is the Spouſe before all other Children, before all other Men, before all other Congregations. Now ſee how the Spouſe doth admire Chriſt, <hi>As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons;</hi> and how the Love of Chriſt doth beget Love; what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a gracious Heart makes of the manifeſtation of Chriſts Love; He declared that he loved her, he loved her dearly above all the World; and preſently ſhe breaths love again. There was a Fire of Love, that was kindled in her boſome, which flamed towards Chriſt; the more love Chriſt manifeſted, the more a gracious Heart loves Chriſt again: You know the Woman in the Goſpel, what abundance of love ſhe expreſt to Chriſt; ſhe ſat at Chriſts Feet weeping, and waſhing Chriſts Feet with her Tears, and wiping them with the Hair of her Head; ſhe had much forgiven, many manifeſtations of Love, in the forgiving her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins; and therefore ſhe loved much. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain obſerve, the Spouſe doth not reſt in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation that Chriſt had given her; he had highly commended her as a Lily among Thorns: But ſhe carries
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42593:4"/> the commendation back again to him; what ever ſhe hath from Chriſt, ſhe carries back again to Chriſt, ſhe 'I make him the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the End of all, and therefore ſhe preſently falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admiration, admiring his Beauty and Excellency. A gracious Heart is more taken with that which is in Chriſt, than with that which he gives out to it: It doth not reſt in Grace that is received, or in Love that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, but it goes back again to Chriſt, pitches upon Chriſt in whom are all Divine perfections: She doth not repeat the words of Chriſt again, as if Chriſt had ſaid, My Love is a Lily among the Thorns; ſhe doth not ſay, Oh, now I am a Lily, I am more beloved than all the World: ſhe looks from that preſently, ſhe looks to Chriſt, how ſhall ſhe make him glorious. The Lord Jeſus, he had ſet a Crown, or at leaſt a Garland upon her Head, and ſhe ſpeedily put off her Garland, and ſet it upon Chriſts Head, ſhe thinks it fit that all ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Glory of Chriſt. Let him be lifted up and magnified, let his Name and Excellency and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be magnified and remembred, though I be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for ever. Oh that you would be more practical, turn this into practice, make it practical, do as the Spouſe did here; let all the manifeſtations of Love kindle love in your Hearts to Chriſt, and look not ſo much what is given to you, as what is laid up in Chriſt for you: Look upon Chriſt, and carry it to him, as he is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> ſo let him be the <hi>Omega,</hi> carry it all back to him again.</p>
            <p>But let us look more ſtrictly upon the words, <hi>As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are clear enough; only it would be known what is meant by <hi>Son, So is my Beloved among the Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be either the Sons of God, or the Sons of Men: The Sons of God, ſo the Angels, and ſo the

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> Now there was a day when the Sons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord;</hi> The Angels are his <hi>Sons,</hi> he uſeth them like Sons, and they ſerve him like Sons. And ſo believers are called the <hi>Sons</hi> of God. <hi>Now we are Sons, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. If we take it in this ſenſe, ſtill it's true of Chriſt, that he is the chief among the <hi>Sons,</hi> among all theſe <hi>Sons of God;</hi> he is far above the Angels; he is made the Head of Principalities and Powers they are all miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto him.</p>
            <p>But we may rather underſtand it of the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaks of ſuch Sons as are Trees of the Foreſt, Trees of the Wood: <hi>At the Apple-tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons.</hi> Among all the Sons of men Chriſt is the chief that ever liv'd, that ever was planted in the Foreſt of the World; God the Father hath given him the preheminence, <hi>he hath given him a Name above every Name, He is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth:</hi> He is more excellent than the chiefeſt of the Sons of Men. Take the beſt of Men which may be, and they are held forth by the names of <hi>Sons. Daughter</hi> in Scripture phraſe is a name of <hi>Weakneſs: Daughter of Sion, Daughter of Jeruſalem:</hi> God would ſhew what poor weak Creatures his people are without him: <hi>Son,</hi> is a name of ſtrength, and honour, and dignity; Among all the Sons of all the Honourable Men in the World, among all the Princes and Potentates in the World, Jeſus Chriſt he is the moſt deſirable, he is more excellent than they: He is more excellent than the talleſt Cedars, than the greateſt Oaks in the Wood; <hi>As the Apple-tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Trees of the Wood:</hi> Here ſeems to be a double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42593:5"/>
            <p>Firſt of all, the Sons of men are compared to the Trees of the Wood.</p>
            <p>And then Secondly, The Son of God is compared to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> among thoſe Trees, in the midſt of thoſe Trees.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Sons of men are compared to the Trees of the Wood, Trees of the Foreſt: And this holds forth the ſtate and condition of men by Nature; Every man by nature is a wild Tree, he is not in Gods Garden, but is caſt out into the open Field, it's a Tree of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, not a Tree of the Orchard. We ſpeak of the corrupted nature of man, what man is ſince the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> For when God made him at firſt, he plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in Paradiſe, and he was the chiefeſt Tree there, brought forth moſt excellent and delightful fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but you know how <hi>Adam</hi> degenerated, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wild Tree, and brought forth ſowre Fruit; and therefore God pluckt him up by the Roots, and threw him out of Paradiſe; ſo that he and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity after him were for ever after Trees of the Wood, and Trees of the Foreſt; he brings forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wild Fruit, till ſuch time as the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take poor creatures and ingraft them again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt, who is the <hi>Root of Jeſſe,</hi> that they may bring forth better fruit unto him.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew wherein this compariſon holds: Every man by Nature is a wild Tree, a Tree of the Wood, a Tree of the Foreſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, He either brings forth no fruit, or elſe he brings forth ſowre fruit; he is an unfruitful creature; <hi>Iſrael is an empty Vine,</hi> God complains: And ſo it's true of every man by Nature, he is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Vine; he is an unfruitful Tree; if he brings forth any fruit, it's wild fruit, it's ſowre fruit; as is ſpoken of in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 32. which doth well reſemble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42593:6"/> of all men by Nature. <hi>Their Vine is a Vine of Sodom,</hi> they are of the field of <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> Here's the fruit that every mans Nature brings forth; It's a Vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and a field of <hi>Gomorrha;</hi> ſowre fruit, and bitter fruit, and curſed fruit. This is the fruit that man by Nature brings forth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, The Trees of the Wood or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſo long as they remain there, they are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they are not of that uſe which the Trees of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, or the Trees of the Garden are, they are not only uſeful for their fruit, but they are a great Ornament to a mans ground or houſe; and they are alſo a defence to a mans houſe. A Tree nigh at home, at the houſe ſide keeps off many a Blaſt, and many a Storm; and ſuch are the Trees that are of Chriſts plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Oh they are a Beauty, they are an Ornament. The Godly man is an Ornament to the place where he grows; The Godly man is a defence to the place where he grows; he keeps off many a ſtorm and Judgement from the place where he lives; and others fare the better for his ſake. But now the Trees of the Wood, they are altogether unuſeful, they ſerve for nothing but to ſhelter the Serpents, and to ſhelter the wild Beaſts, and this is the condition of every natural man. Oh what Serpents, and what wild Beaſts, what baſe luſts, and what hideous Monſters are ſheltered in the heart of a Natural man, that is a ſtranger to Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, The Trees that are in the Wood or Foreſt, they grow in Wilderneſſes, and have none to look after them, there's none prune them, there's none to hedge them, they lye open to all dangers, to the Horns and to the Teeth of the wild Beaſts, that will eaſily knock off all their Budds and Springs, break and eat off their bark, and keep them from growing, and the like: And truly this is the condition of every Natural
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42593:6"/> man; he is as a Tree in the Foreſt, as a Tree in the Wilderneſs; there is none to look after him, there is none to prune him, and to take away unfruitful branches, that he may bring forth fruit to God, God doth not look after the Trees in the Foreſt: It's true, Chriſt is the Fathers Husbandman, and he doth cut off unfruitful Branches; he cuts off unfruitful Trees that bring forth untimely fruit. But he doth this to ſuch as are in his Garden, to ſuch as are in his Chriſt. Thus the Father takes a ſpecial care of his. The Lord makes a round hedge about his people; he'l keep all hurtful things from them. See what is ſaid to <hi>Job:</hi> The Devil confeſſes the goodneſs of God unto his people in this reſpect, <hi>Job 1. 10. Haſt not thou made a hedge about him, and about his houſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all that he hath on every ſide?</hi> It's a moſt certain truth, that God hath made a hedge about his people, a hedge about him, a hedge about his perſon, a hedge about his houſe; that is, a hedge about his family, a hedge about his Friends and Relations, a hedge about his people. There is a three-fold hedge that God makes about his, that are of his planting: But now it's not ſo of the Trees in the Foreſt, of the Trees in the Wilderneſs, there's no hedge made about them, they lie open to a thouſand dangers; they lie open to the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſaults of <hi>Satan,</hi> and to the prevalency of all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, lie open to dangers from all the Creatures, there's no hedge about them: God hath not made a League with the Beaſts in the Field for them. Here is the miſery of a man out of Chriſt, it is ſet forth by a Tree that is in the Wilderneſs, a Tree that grows in the Wood: And therefore a word of Application to this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Beloved, This lets us ſee the neceſſity of being planted into Chriſt by faith. We are all of the wild Olive, and the wild Vine; and therefore there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that every man ſhould ſeek after his tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42593:7"/> into Chriſt. Oh that the Lord would make you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be pluckt up by the Roots! You that are out of Chriſt, be willing to be pluckt up by the Roots, that you may be planted into Chriſt. There is ſome rooting that every natural man hath which he is loth to be pluckt from: One man is rooted into the World, and another is rooted in his luſts, and another is rooted in himſelf, in his own righteouſneſs, in his own works, in his own ſtrength, in his own performances. Oh that the Lord would make you willing to be pluckt up from all that Root, that in which you have any thing beſides Chriſt: Here is the great difficulty, to bring off the wills of men. Men cry out many times, Oh it is a hard matter, Oh it's an impoſſible thing, that ever they ſhould be pluckt up from ſuch Rooting: That they have ſuch luſts, Trees which are of twenty, thirty, forty years growth; and all that time rooting deeper and deeper: Is it poſſible that ſuch ſhould be plucked up by the Roots, and planted into Chriſt?</p>
            <p>My Brethren, it's poſſible if men were willing to be pluckt up, the Lord would ſoon accompliſh it. You know what Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples; that if they had <hi>Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, they ſhould ſay to this Cedar, be removed into the Sea, and it ſhould be ſo.</hi> Why, the Lord can make poor Creatures to do that which is impoſſible for ſenſe and reaſon to think may be done: Oh what is it that the Lord can't do! There is no Oake, there is no Cedar, ſo ſtrong and ſo tall, and ſo deeply rooted, but the Lord can ſay, Be thou removed, be thou plucked up by the Roots: There is no Tree ſo barren, there is no Soul grows in ſuch a barren Soyl, but the Lord can ſay, Be thou plucked up, and be thou rooted in that fruitful Soyl. Oh that the Lord would make the hearts of men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be pluckt up by the Roots, from that rooting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42593:7"/> which they have in ſin, or which they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ſo they may be planted in a better ſoyl, and rooted in the Lord Jeſus. Do but remember this, that you may ſee what a neceſſity there is that every man ſhould ſeek after their planting in Chriſt. Why, ſo long as you are out of Chriſt, you are wild Trees, ſo long as you are out of Chriſt, you bring forth no fruit; you bring forth no good fruit. Our Saviour makes it an impoſſible thing, in <hi>Mat. 7. 17. Even ſo every good Tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil fruit:</hi> It's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ever the fruit ſhould be good ſo long as the Tree is evil. Now ſo long as a Man is out of Chriſt, he is an evil Tree, he is a wild Tree, a Tree of the Wood, a Tree of the Foreſt, not a Tree of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Oh that men would be made good, that their Trees might bring forth good fruit. Truly it's in vain to teach men to bring forth good fruit, until ſuch time as the Tree be made good. If the Tree were made good, and ingrafted into Chriſt, it's impoſſible that that good Tree ſhould bring forth evil fruit. Oh know you that have Intereſt in Chriſt, that all the fruit that you bring forth out of Chriſt is loſt; I ſay, Men and Women, they loſe all their fruit; It's ſuch as the Lord can't accept of, ſuch as the Lord doth not delight in. The Lord could not endure that fruit that <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought forth, in the firſt of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> they were a <hi>burden</hi> to him, their fruit he was weary of; they and all the fruit that they brought forth to God were caſt out. What a pitiful thing is it that a man ſhould loſe all his fruit, all his Labour, and all his pains? Yea truly, till a man be in Chriſt all is loſt. You know the young man in the Goſpel, that came to Chriſt, he had a great deal of good Moral fruit, he had <hi>kept all the Commandments,</hi> he ſaid,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42593:8"/> 
               <hi>from his youth,</hi> and yet all that fruit was loſt, it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and fell off before it was ripe, it rotted and periſhed, it was never gathered by Chriſt, his Soul did never eat of it, it was no delight to him; And why? becauſe though the Tree had a great deal of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good fruit on it, yet it was an evil Tree, it was a wild Tree.</p>
            <p>Nay, Let men conſider further, what a fearful word was ſpoken againſt ſuch wild Trees, as bring forth no fruit to God, or ſuch fruit as is ſowre, as his Soul can have no pleaſure nor delight in; it was a dreadful Word ſpoken by <hi>Daniel,</hi> which was ſpoken concerning the great Tree; ſee <hi>Dan. 4. 14. Hew down the Tree, and cut off the Branches, and ſcatter the Leaves, and the fruit.</hi> Why, this was ſpoken of the mighty Tree, which reached up to Heaven, a Tree that did fill the whole Earth with its outward Glory; and yet of this very Tree, God ſaid, <hi>Hew it down,</hi> and it was hewn down. Oh that men would remember, there is no outward priviledge, that can exempt a man from the ſtroak of the Lord. He can breath upon the talleſt Cedars, and the greateſt Oaks; if the Lord blow upon them, they ſhall wither as the Graſs in the Field: <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the Tree,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, in Mat. 3. 10. <hi>Therefore every Tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the Fire.</hi> Now that the Goſpel is preached, now that Chriſt himſelf is come to offer terms of peace unto him, now that God from Heaven hath declared his willingneſs to pluck men out of the curſed Soyl of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to implant them into his Son; now, now, if men ſubmit not unto Chriſt, if they continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, hew them down and make them fewel for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Fire. Oh now ſee then how it concerns every man to ſeek to be implanted into Chriſt. It's
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42593:8"/> not a leaning upon Chriſt that will ſerve mens turns, but there muſt be a planting into Chriſt, a rooting in Chriſt: the Apricock doth lean upon the wall, but it's not rooted into the wall, it hath not its life from the wall, but it's rooted in the Ground. And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor creature may pretend, he is leaning upon Chriſt, and in the mean time he is rooted in the World, in his filthineſs, in his baſe luſts and corruptions, this man is not rooted into Chriſt: So much to that firſt Similitude. Thus you ſee that the Sons of men are compared to the Trees in the Wood, to the Trees in the Foreſt; <hi>As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Son of God (I ſhall ſpeak but a Word to that) he is compared unto the Apple-tree in the midſt of the Trees in the Wood, or of the Foreſt.</p>
            <p>But why is the Son of God ſet forth here by the <hi>Apple-tree?</hi> There are many Trees that are of more worth than the Apple-tree; why not the Cedar? and why not the Oak? Why ſet forth here by the <hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Chriſt is ſet forth by the Apple-tree for the <hi>fruitfulneſs</hi> of this Tree. It's a fruit-bearing Tree; it brings forth abundance of uſeful fruit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is uſually ſet forth by this Tree rather than others. It's a very fit Simile to ſet forth Chriſt by the Apple-tree; Chriſt was a fruit-bearing Tree. Oh what abundance of pleaſant delightful fruit did Jeſus Chriſt bring forth! Such as did rejoyce the Soul of God his Father, and of men and Angels. He was fruitful all his days; he continually brought forth fruit, all the time of his being upon Earth, all the time that he was planted by the Father, in the Nurſery here in this world. He was fruitful even upon his firſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42593:9"/> planting here, he made it his meat and his drink to do the will of his Father. He was never well but when he was bearing ſome fruit. The fruit that Chriſt bare when he was upon Earth, it ſhall laſt to Eternity; It's that which the Saints ſhall feed upon for ever and ever. The fruit that the Apple-tree bears, it's both an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it ſelf, and it's exceeding beautiful, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial unto others; and therefore ſtill fit is it to ſet forth this Simile, for it's a fruit-bearing Tree, a beautiful ſight, a delightful ſight: The Lord Jeſus he was laden with fruit, every Branch and every Bough full of fruit. It's ſaid, <hi>We ſaw his Glory as the Glory of the only begotten Son, full of Grace and truth.</hi> So Chriſt he is full of Grace and Truth; and this is the Glory of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, being full of Grace and full of Truth. And then he is of benefit to others. The fruit of this Tree is exceeding beneficial to others. How many are fed, and nouriſhed and refreſhed by the fruit of the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree? It's a Tree that man could not ſpare of all the Trees that God hath planted. The fruit this Tree brings forth, it ſerves both for Meat and Drink; it will both ſatisfie the Appetite, and quench the thirſt alſo, which many other fruits will not do. Thus ſtill this holds forth Chriſt, who is compleat nouriſhment to his people, he <hi>is meat indeed,</hi> and he is <hi>drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;</hi> he ſatisfies the hungry Soul with good things, he quenches the thirſt of the poor, dry and parched Soul. There is a drink that is made of Apples, which is very uſeful (we know) for the quenching of thirſt, for the allaying of heat: Such is that refreſhment that Chriſt gives out unto his people; he is content that his very heart blood ſhould be ſqueezed out, that ſo his people might drink of it, that they might be refreſhed, cooled and revived, that all the heat of his Fathers wrath might be allayed in them.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42593:9"/> This is the will of Chriſt, this is a Similitude that Chriſt is held forth by, like unto an <hi>Apple-Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Then Secondly, For the <hi>ſhadow</hi> that this Tree caſts, that alſo is held forth in the Text, <hi>I ſat under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi> There are ſome Trees that bear fruit, but caſt no great ſhadow; other Trees caſt a ſhadow, that bear no fruit that is deſirable. Ay, but both theſe meet in Chriſt; he is as the Apple-tree that brings forth fruit, and alſo caſts a comfortable ſhadow. This makes the fruit more delightful, when a man can ſtand under the ſhadow and gather the fruit of the Tree; it makes the fruit exceeding pleaſant to him, he is not ſcorched with the Sun whilſt he gathers it. Oh there is a ſweet ſhadow, a ſweet comfortable and refreſhing ſhadow, which the Lord Jeſus doth caſt over his people, whilſt they pluck that fruit, and eat of that fruit which grows upon him. But then,</p>
            <p>3. Again, Thirdly, His fruit is commended for the <hi>Smell</hi> of it, in <hi>Cant. 7. 8. Now alſo thy Breaſts ſhall be as a cluſter of the Vine, and the ſmell of thy Noſe like Apples.</hi> That is, that very breath that comes from thee, all thy breathings they are ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they have a ſweet ſavour in them; thy breathings after God and Chriſt they are full of Grace; and they are full of holineſs. <hi>The Smell it's like the ſmell of Apples:</hi> There are ſome Apples that are of a very fragrant ſmell, as your Pomecitrons and others, and ſome have thought them to be the Apples here meant in the Text; and this doth well ſet forth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for that ſweet and fragrant ſmell that he ſends forth. Oh what a ſweet ſavour was he unto God! And what a ſweet ſavour is he unto man! It's ſaid, <hi>he offered himſelf a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42593:10"/> unto God:</hi> He carried his ſacrifice as his fruit, and it was a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God. And ſo Chriſt is a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto man alſo; where there is any thing of Chriſt in a Creature, it makes that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſweet; where there is any thing of Chriſt in an Ordinance, it makes that Ordinance ſmell ſweet; where there is any thing of Chriſt in a duty, it makes that duty ſmell ſweet. <hi>Becauſe of the ſweet ſavour of thine Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it's therefore the Virgins follow thee. It's Chriſt that makes the Goſpel of a ſweet ſavour; Chriſt in a perſon, or Chriſt in an Ordinance, or Chriſt in any condition makes that thing ſweet.</p>
            <p>4. And again, Fourthly, This Tree it's a <hi>Common Tree,</hi> and therefore Chriſt would rather be reſembled by this Tree than by any others, which are not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and are not ſo uſeful. There is almoſt no part in the World but hath ſome kind of Apple-trees. It's a fruit more common than many others, that even the pooreſt may eat of it. And therefore the Lord Jeſus he may be reſembled by this Tree, to hold forth, that he is a common ſaviour, that he is free for all poor creatures to come unto, he is the Apple-tree in all parts of the World, that men in all places might come in and feed upon him and be ſatisfied. And therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>A Fountain ſet open,</hi> in <hi>Zech. 13. A Fountain ſet open;</hi> it ſhall not be ſealed up, but a Fountain ſet open. The Goſpel tenders Chriſt freely; and in that reſpect is Chriſt compared to <hi>A fountain ſet open.</hi> He is alſo compared here to an Apple-tree for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs as well as for the uſefulneſs of that fruit, that none might plead Ignorance, that they might not plead excuſe, that none might ſay he was ſuch a fruit as none could buy, that they could not come at. No, Chriſt would be reſembled unto that which is common, that he might be held forth freely unto poor loſt ſinners under the Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42593:10"/>
            <p>5. And then fifthly and laſtly, He is ſet forth by the Apple-tree for the <hi>variety of fruits</hi> which it does bring forth, and do grow upon this Tree. There is no Tree that brings forth ſuch <hi>variety</hi> of fruit. How many ſorts, ſeveral kinds of Apples? they are almoſt innumerable. And truly in this reſpect Chriſt is the Apple-tree, becauſe of thoſe innumerable precious Gifts and Graces which do grow upon him. The fulneſs of the Spirit was poured out upon him; it made him to bring forth fruits of all kinds. He is the only begotten Son of God full of Grace and Truth: There can be no excellency, nor no perfection named, which is not to be found in the Son of God, they all do concenter and meet in him. I ſhall ſay no more at this time, but leave the Metaphor unto your conſideration; think of it. The Lord Jeſus was pleaſed to be reſembled to an Apple-tree. And what great condeſcenſion of Love is this, that he ſhould ſtoop down ſo low to ſet forth himſelf under ſuch a mean compariſon, that we might know what goodlineſs and ſweetneſs are in him: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the love of Chriſt is held forth in this, that he ſhould chooſe to be ſet forth by ſuch a Tree as this is, by the Apple-tree; you ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would rather chooſe a Fruitful Tree, than a Great Tree, than a Strong Tree, he having ſuch a delight in being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful,</hi> in being <hi>Serviceable,</hi> in <hi>Bringing forth Fruit</hi> unto his Father; Fruit that ſhould be for the good of the Sons of men. And therefore let us look to Chriſt, and labour to imitate Chriſt; the Lord he delights in a fruitful Tree, rather than in a Tall Tree, or in a Strong Tree; it's the Greateſt Commendation that can be, to be Fruitful, and Serviceable, to bring forth Fruit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42593:11"/> to God and our Generation; Chriſt choſe this, and let us chooſe it too; and let us look to God who is the Husband-man, who makes all this Trees to be fruitful Trees in his due time. So much for this time.</p>

            <p>I Have made entrance the laſt day: Here is a double compariſon, the Sons of men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Trees of the Wood; The Son of God is compared to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> among thoſe Trees.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add a fifth particular wherein the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance holds.</p>
            <p>5. Chriſt here is ſet forth as the Apple-tree: It ſeems to relate to the fruit of that Tree that Man did eat in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, which in all probability was a kind of Apples: And herein we call to mind how man loſt his happineſs, where it was that man undid himſelf, how ſin came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World by eating of the forbidden fruit; as alſo it holds forth that <hi>Chriſt hath taken away that Curſe</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42593:11"/> all the bitterneſs and wrath for his people, which was the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion. There was man undone at firſt, under the Apple-tree, there he loſt himſelf, and God, and Happineſs: And therefore Chriſt will be an Apple-tree as ſhall bring forth better Fruit, the Fruits of Peace, Joy, Life and Salvation for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: See what is ſaid, <hi>Cant. 8. 5. Who is this that cometh up from the Wilderneſs leaning upon her Beloved? I raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree: There thy Mother brought thee forth, there ſhe brought forth that bare thee.</hi> Some make it to be the words of the Spouſe to Chriſt, <hi>I raiſed thee up under the Apple-tree;</hi> She looks up to Chriſt, and ſaith, Lord <hi>I took hold of thy Boughs,</hi> I took hold of thy Covenant, I took hold of thy Promiſe by Faith and Prayer, there I raiſed thee up: He roſe up to be a help and deliverer of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But others make them to be the Words of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt ſpeaks unto his Spouſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Apple-tree there I raiſed thee up.</hi> It ſhould ſeem to have a reference to the Tree which was the Occaſion of Mans fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou loſt thy ſelf under the Apple-tree, there was thy fall; there did the Devil thruſt down Man, <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity. Well ſays Chriſt, I'le be an Apple-tree, and under this Apple-tree i'le raiſe thee up again: under this Apple-tree thou ſhalt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, thou ſhalt be ſaved, i'le raiſe thee up again. The Lord Jeſus he came to undo the works of <hi>Satan,</hi> becauſe <hi>Satan</hi> had undone the Works of his Father, and ſpoiled the whole creation with ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus will Chriſt be avenged of him: Chriſt will be ſuch an Apple-tree, that will bring forth that fruit which ſhall be the deſtruction of <hi>Satan;</hi> the deſtruction of Death and Hell, which were brought into the World by the diſobedience of <hi>Man</hi> under the Tree. So then I ſay this may be held forth,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42593:12"/>1. Firſt, That the Lord would have his people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what they loſt in <hi>Adam</hi> by their diſobedience, and then the Lord would have them remember the Lord Jeſus, he hath taken away all that curſe, and all that wrath which was the deſert of mans diſobedience; ſo that it ſhall not be poured upon believers. And ſo much for the compariſon betwixt Chriſt and the Apple-tree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's ſaid further, That he is as <hi>the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood.</hi> The next work then is to enquire after that compariſon; Why is Chriſt ſaid to be the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood? Why not among the Trees of the Garden? There is much in this compariſon; receive it with <hi>Attention,</hi> for I ſhall be but ſhort in this work.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, It holds forth, That the Lord Jeſus took the ſame Nature that we have, he became man; he took upon him the Nature of man. It's true, he was not a wild Tree, but he was a Tree as well as the reſt of the Trees in the Wood; he was of the ſame Subſtance with them; he had the ſame Body, the ſame Bark, the ſame Rind, the ſame out-ſide, that other Trees had; he was in all things made like unto us, we read in <hi>Heb. 2. 14, 17. For as much then as the Children are partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that though death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; wherefore in all things, it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the People,</hi> &amp;c. It was needful that he ſhould be made partaker of Fleſh and Blood, there was a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. For firſt of all,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus was that ſtock or that root, upon which God the Father had determined to graft all the Sons and Daughters of men, that he had appointed to be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42593:12"/> Trees of Righteouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in his Paradiſe. I ſay all that were to be made Trees of Righteouſneſs, were to be engrafted into that ſtock, and therefore there was a neceſſity that the ſtock ſhould be like unto the Cyons, it was neceſſary that the branch and the root ſhould be of one nature.</p>
            <p>Again, The Lord Jeſus was to fill all his Branches with Life and Spirit, the Sap and Juice muſt run from the root to the Branches, and therefore it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſhould be Homogeneal, of one Nature; that they ſhould be incorporated, and made one, that ſo Chriſt might fill our Nature, that humane Nature which he took into the ſecond perſon, with all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and from that, and through that, fill all his Members. That's the Firſt, That Chriſt is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to an Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But again Secondly, This compariſon does hold forth the unſpotted Nature, and that holineſs which was in Jeſus Chriſt; It holds it forth in the excellency of it: He was an Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood: He was not a wild Tree as they were, though he grew amongſt the wild Trees; though he grew in the World, yet he did not partake of the ſin of the World; there was no corruption in him, he brought forth no wild fruit: And herein is the excellency of Chriſt held forth. To ſee an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, a ſweet Apple in the midſt of an Orchard, is no great wonder; but to find an Apple-tree laden with goodly and pleaſant fruit, where there is nothing but a Wood and a Foreſt, and wild Trees, and Bryars, and Thorns, and Brambles round about, this is a wonder; and even thus was the Lord Jeſus, the Trees round about him were wild Trees; <hi>they are all gone out of the way</hi> (it's ſpoken of the wild Trees) <hi>and become altogether unprofitable, there is none that doth good no not one.</hi> This is the natural Eſtate of all men;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42593:13"/> and that Chriſt ſhould be planted in the midſt of theſe, and yet be an Apple-tree, and bring forth ſweet and bleſſed fruit, this was his great commendation; and the Spouſe does here admire him for it. Before he was admiring the Spouſe, <hi>as a Lily among Thorns,</hi> the tender Lily among the Thorns; and here the Spouſe doth admire that the Lord Jeſus ſhould be a green Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood: That none of the corruption of mans Nature ſhould cleave unto him, that he ſhould bring forth nothing but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruit; he was the Lamb of God without ſpot, and <hi>there was no guile found in his mouth:</hi> Here is the great Commendation of Chriſt; ſtill a pleaſant Apple-tree, though in the midſt of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trees of the Wood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, The compariſon holds forth the High and Honourable eſteem that the Spouſe had of Chriſt, <hi>As the Apple-tree amongſt the Trees of the Wood;</hi> as the Apple-tree is to be preferred before the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my Beloved to be preferred before all the Sons of men: He had preferred the Spouſe as much as the Lily is to be preferred before the Thorns: And here ſhe returns his love back again, ſaith ſhe, He is to be preferred before the Sons of men; as the Apple-tree is to be preferred before and beyond the Trees of the Wood. What ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ſpeaking of all things in compariſon of Chriſt <hi>to be but Dung and Droſs: Yea verily,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I count all things but Droſs and Dung in compariſon of Chriſt;</hi> how precious is Chriſt to a gracious ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all is but Droſs and Dung in compariſon of him; <hi>to you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter) he is precious;</hi> you that have taſted of the comforts of this Tree, you'l ſay, Oh Lord, give me evermore to eat of this Tree: That's a third particular wherein the compariſon holds.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42593:13"/>4. Fourthly, It holds forth that mean and low Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the men in the world have of Chriſt. They look upon him as a Common tree; he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trees in the wood; and he is of no better account than the trees of the wood, <hi>Cant. 5. 9. what is thy beloved</hi> (ſay they) <hi>more than anothers beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They could not believe, that there ſhould be any thing of worth more in Chriſt than was in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and other things; <hi>what is thy beloved?</hi> they could not believe that he was any more than another tree, becauſe he grew among them; and truly it's becauſe men know not the worth of Chriſt and have no Eſteem of him; they have not taſted and ſeen how good and gracious the Lord is, and therefore they have no high account of the precious fruit that growes on this tree. The carnal heart cloſeth with the world and cloſeth with his luſts; they are his <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> his Beloved: and when he looks upon a child of God, ſees a gracious heart go lamenting after Chriſt; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that hath found Chriſt rejoyces in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſolaceth himſelf in the fruit of this tree; Why, this is the wonder unto a carnal heart; <hi>why? What's thy Beloved more than my Beloved?</hi> what do you find more in Chriſt, than I find in the world, than I find in my luſts? Oh it's a dreadful deceit of a mans heart. <hi>Can a man gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thiſtles?</hi> Is it poſſible that the wild tree can bring forth as good fruit as the Apple-tree? No, it's the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of men that they know not Chriſt; that Chriſt is not precious to them. But again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, This compariſon holds forth the great ſufferings of Chriſt: he is ſaid to be the Apple-tree in the foreſt, or in the wood; becauſe of the ſufferings that Chriſt was expoſed to when he was on earth. You know the trees in the foreſt, they ly open to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42593:14"/> Storms, there's no fence about them, they lye open to the teeth and horns of the wild beaſts; and thus did Chriſt ſuffer when he was upon earth: he laid open to moſt grievous Storms, to blow upon him: the very wrath of God his Father went over his head; it blow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſore upon him, that it even brake his tree to pieces. <hi>It pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, Iſaiah</hi> 53. 10. It pleaſed the father to bruiſe him and to put him to grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea it pleaſed the father to break him in pieces. Moreover he met with a world of ſufferings from men: Oh how was he perſecuted from firſt to laſt? How many <hi>Pſalms</hi> are there in which <hi>David</hi> doth complain in the perſon of Chriſt? He complains of the wild beaſts in the foreſt, the Dogs, the Lyons, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns, and the wild Buls of <hi>Baſhan</hi> incompaſſed him round about, <hi>Pſalm 22. 20, 21. Deliver my ſoul from the ſword: my darling from the power of the dog. Save me from the Lyons mouth: for thou haſt heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</hi> And in divers other <hi>Pſalms</hi> which he made of Chriſt, and in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects, Chriſt is compared to a tree, a tree of the foreſt. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, He is a tree in the foreſt, an Apple-tree in the foreſt, for that <hi>unexpected comfort and relief</hi> that the Lord Jeſus doth afford for poor ſouls: <hi>unexpected comfort and relief;</hi> when a man hath been travelling all the day long in a foreſt or wood, hungry and dry and thirſty, he caſts his eye upon a well laden Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree full of goodly fruit, Oh how welcome is it, and ſo much the more welcome, becauſe he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find ſuch a tree there: and ſo it is with poor creatures: how many are there wandering up and down in the world, hungry and thirſty and ready to faint, then doth Chriſt ſtep in ſeaſonably, then doth Chriſt preſent himſelf unto poor ſouls as an Apple-tree laden
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42593:14"/> with delighful fruit; he ſayes, Poor ſoul, thou ſhalt not famiſh, I will not ſuffer thee to famiſh; come take and eat of my fruit, and let thy ſoul for ever be ſatisfied in me. Now the unexpectedneſs of the mercy doth heighten the mercy. I had thought I ſhould never have ſeen thy face, ſays <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and now God hath ſhewed it to me. Surely. <hi>Hagar</hi> was mightily taken with that fountain or well that was ſhewen to her in the wilderneſs, when ſhe was ready to periſh, when ſhe had given over her child for loſt, and there was no water to give; then for the well to be ſhewen her, ſurely this was a very welcome thing to her: and ſo when the ſoul is ready to faint, how often doth Chriſt preſent himſelf, as a well in the wilderneſs, and as an Apple-tree in the midſt of the wood or foreſt; and how pleaſant and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is that? But again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, In the next place, He is ſaid to be an Apple-tree among the Trees of the wood, becauſe of the freeneſs of Chriſt: it holds forth much of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in beſtowing of himſelf upon poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; an Apple-tree among the Trees of the wood, that's free for every man, for every man to take of, and eat of: If an Apple-tree be in a garden or an Orchard, a man may ſee it a great way off, and can't taſte of it; he may deſire it, and his ſtomach may be for it, but he deſpairs of it, becauſe it's none of his: but an Apple-tree in a wood, that's free for all, for all that paſs by; there's none excluded; but he that wants may go and take and eat of the fruit of it. It holds forth much of the fruit of Chriſts love, he is not only an Apple-tree in the wood, but he is an Apple-tree in the foreſt: and therefore thoſe tenders of grace that are held forth, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. 1, 2, 3. See there what invitation is made; <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42593:15"/> ye, buy and eat, yea, come buy wine and milk without money, and without price,</hi> &amp;c. yea though a man has no money, yet he may come and drink of this water, and eat of the fruit of this Tree. That's a ſeventh particular.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eightly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But again, in the Eighth place, Chriſt is ſaid to be a Tree among the Trees of the wood, Becauſe there are very few that go forth to ſeek Chriſt, and few there are that find him, and ſeed upon him by faith. An Apple-tree that is in the midſt of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, how few are there that feed on that Tree? It may be God by a ſpecial providence directs a poor, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hungry traveller, a weary man to that Tree; but how few are there that go to ſeek it! Men that have an Orchard at home, will hardly go to the wood. Men that have Orchards of their own, Trees grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, they will not go abroad: they which were invited to the feaſt, you know they would not come, they had enough, they had no need of Chriſt as they thought; and therefore they would take no pains. The Lord by his ſpecial grace muſt direct the poor ſoul to Chriſt, or elſe it's impoſſible they ſhould come to him: indeed men will not come to Chriſt; <hi>ye will not come to me,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>that I may give you life.</hi> In all theſe reſpects Chriſt is ſaid here to be an Apple-tree, among the Trees of the wood: And therefore to conclude with one word of Application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This lets us ſee the uſefulneſs and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: What's more uſeful and deſirable in your Orchard, than the Apple-tree? If a man hath never ſo many Trees in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, he never thinks his Orchard compleat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he hath ſome Apple-trees. Oh that the Lord would perſwade your hearts, to look unto the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-tree,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42593:15"/> look to get the Apple-tree into your Orchard; get Chriſt into your hearts. Oh he is an uſeful and deſirable Tree. Let me tell you the benefit of it in a word or two.</p>
            <p>It will be a comfortable <hi>ſhelter</hi> to you. The Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree that is Planted in your Orchard, it will keep off a ſtorm from your houſe. Chriſt in the heart is a comfortable ſhelter to the poor ſoul. Oh how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſtorm of wrath and indignation, which blowes from Heaven, and Chriſt keeps it off from the poor Soul!</p>
            <p>Nay again, Let me tell you that this Apple-tree it's a <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> and therefore worth the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, that you may get him planted in your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. I ſay it's a Tree of Life, whoſoever eats of this Tree lives for ever. <hi>Your fathers they did eat Manna in the wilderneſs,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>and they are dead,</hi> John 6. 58. <hi>but he that eats of the bread that I ſhall give him, ſhall never die,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>he ſhall live for ever:</hi> it muſt needs be ſo, for Chriſt he is a Tree of Life.</p>
            <p>Again, He is not only a Tree of Life, but he is a <hi>Tree of knowledge:</hi> and therefore worth the ſeeking aften. You read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3. of the <hi>Tree of knowledge</hi> that was in the midſt of the garden, which the woman lookt upon: and it was very deſirable for three things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. verſ. <hi>The woman ſaw, that the Tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eye, and a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe; ſhe took of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and did eat, and gave alſo to her husband.</hi> Truly all this is to be found in Chriſt; he is good for food ye heard before, they that eat of him, ſhall live for ever. He is pleaſant to the eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh how beautiful is he in his Nature, and in his perſon! <hi>thou art fairer than the Children of men:</hi> and he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42593:16"/> to make one wiſe; he that feeds upon Chriſt is made wiſe indeed; he that knows Chriſt, is the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt man in the world; it's Chriſt that opens the eye: the eating of Chriſt, this Tree, opens the eyes and makes men wiſe, wiſe to ſalvation, wiſe to know and underſtand the great myſteries of God in Chriſt, even thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries hid from ages and generations. Again, I might tell you, This Tree, <hi>it brings forth fruit at all times,</hi> and therefore deſirable; the Apple-trees in your gardens and Orchards, they wo'nt bring forth fruit in winter; but this Apple-tree, Chriſt, every Month in the year, every Summer and winter, every day of the Month: look upon Chriſt with an eye of Faith, and you ſhall find him full laden with fruit. Oh how uſeful a tree is Chriſt! Again.</p>
            <p>I might tell you alſo, here you might have a ſtaff to lean on, upon this Tree you might have a ſtaff to lean on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I am thy God to old age.</hi> The waters that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> drank of, were bitter till ſuch time as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> cut down boughs, and they made the waters ſweet; ſuch boughs grow upon this Apple-tree; it will make your bitter waters ſweet. Oh there is love in Chriſt, there is goodneſs in Chriſt, and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which if caſt into thoſe bitter waters, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſorest bittereſt afflictions, theſe boughs will make them ſweet. Get into this Apple-tree. Why do you endeavour to get Bryars and Thorns, and Oaks and wild Trees and Crab-trees, and in the mean time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this Apple-tree? there is a Curſe upon the ground and on every ſoul, even the curſe of the ground, thorns and thiſtles, and theſe here will grow, till ſuch time as Chriſt be planted: Nay, if Chriſt be not planted in the garden, God the Father can't walk there; If the Tree of Life be not there, if the Tree of Knowledge be not there. God takes no delight to walk in the garden. The ſoul
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42593:16"/> out of Chriſt, where Chriſt is not planted, that ſoul can have no gracious and ſweet communion with him? Well then,</p>
            <p>What an Invitation is here for poor ſouls to come in to Chriſt? Chriſt is the Apple-tree, an Apple-tree in the midſt of the trees of the wood: Oh! why will men reject Chriſt? Poor ſinners, why are you fearful through unbelief, to come to Chriſt? If Chriſt were a bryar or thorn or thiſtle, you might be afraid of him; but he is as the Apple-tree among the Trees of the wood; he is laden with fruitful branches; if Chriſt were a Tree hemmed in, walled in, you might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of having any fruit, but he is open to you: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thirſts let him come, who ever hungers let him come, take and eat of this fruit. Poor ſouls you have the leave of God, nay, you have not only leave, but you have command to come and eat of this Tree of life: it's the commandment, that you come and believe in Jeſus Chriſt. Oh what ſtragling and perverſe hearts lodge in our boſoms! There was a time when God ſaid <hi>of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, Thou ſhalt not eat of</hi> it, and then man would eat; and now the Lord hath ſet up another tree of life, and the Lord ſayes, Thou ſhall eat of this tree of Life, and now they will not, though the eating then, and the not eating now is like to coſt many thouſand ſouls lives. The Lord help you to conſider of it!</p>

            <p>I Told you before, here is a twofold compariſon, the ſons of men are compared to the <hi>Trees of the wood,</hi> the Trees of the foreſt, which are wild Trees, which hold forth the ſtate of all men by Nature; we have done with that.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, The ſon of God is compared to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> among thoſe Trees. I ſhewed you in what reſpect Chriſt is compared to the <hi>Apple-tree;</hi> and the laſt day I ſhewed why Chriſt is ſaid to be as the <hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree among the Trees of the wood:</hi> why not an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree among the Trees of the Garden, but as the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree among the Trees of the wood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, let ſuch as profeſs the name of Chriſt, be like unto Chriſt. That's the uſe of the point I ſhall make at this time. They that profeſs Chriſt muſt be like Chriſt. Labour to be fruitful Trees, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing trees; and look that your fruit be of this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42593:17"/> Apple-tree, and bring forth much of this fruit, as Chriſt did: yea be like unto Chriſt in being Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees in the midſt of the wood. To this head I ſhall reduce all that I ſhall preſs upon you at this time.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Chriſtians ſhould labour to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing trees: the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would rather be ſet forth by a fruit-bearing tree, than by a tree of ſtrength, or a tree of tallneſs; not the Oak or the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, but the Apple-tree, and that becauſe it's a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing tree. Oh how ſhould Chriſtians labour to be fruitful in their place! it's better to be ſerviceable to God and man, in your place and Generation, and relation, than to have places, titles, honours and dignities amongſt the great ones of the world: and Chriſtians ſhould rather chooſe to be ſerviceable to God and man, than to ſeek great things for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the world: there's a notable parable in <hi>Judges 9. 8. The trees went forth on a time to anoint a King over them, and they ſaid unto the Olive-tree, Reign thou over us. But the Olive-tree ſaid unto them, Should I leave my fatneſs wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</hi> There was a particular application of the parable: the Sons of <hi>Gedeon</hi> choſe rather to be uſeful in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than to be honourable in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> it holds forth thus much in general, a gracious heart will rather chooſe a place of ſervice than a place of honour; <hi>I will not leave my goodneſs, my ſweetneſs and my fatneſs,</hi> ſayes the Olive-tree, fig-tree and the vine: no though to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted over and beyond other trees: conſider that it is the greateſt Commendation of a Chriſtian to be a ſerviceable and fruit-bearing tree; I ſay it is the greateſt commendation unto men that they are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable unto God in their place and generation: look
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42593:18"/> unto <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. ſee what a ſpecial commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation God gives of him, <hi>v. 36. after he had ſerved his own generation, by the will of God he then fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep:</hi> it was the greateſt commendation that God could give <hi>David,</hi> when he would ſpeak honourably of <hi>David;</hi> when <hi>David</hi> is gone, this was his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he ſerved his generation, he was a fruit-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tree, he ſerved his generation according to the will of God; He ſought the glory of God, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to do good to the ſons of men whilſt he was here upon earth; and ſo <hi>David ſerved his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Brethren, it's no commendation for a man to live long, if he don't ſerve his generation; It's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for a tree to ſtand a hundred years, if it ben't a fruitful Tree: Let us ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all wherein God begins to commend <hi>David;</hi> he begins at the ſervice of his Generation: as if God did not take notice of other time that men ſpend, in which there is no ſervice done to him; he doth not ſay after he had lived ſo long, or after he had ſerved ſo long, but <hi>after he had ſerved his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the will of God;</hi> A man may live a hundred years upon earth, and may ſtand ſo long, and yet be an accurſed tree all the time of his ſtanding, if he be not a fruitful tree, and a tree doing ſome good for his generation wherein he lives: you may ſee the prophecie of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, 65. 20. But the ſinner being an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed:</hi> ſo that it is not ſimply a bleſſing to live long, to ſtand long, if a man be not a fruitful Tree; for a man may ſtand a hundred years, ſayes the Scripture, and yet all that time be under a curſe. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I beſeech you remember that you have the example of Chriſt: you have the example of Chriſt and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42593:18"/> of his people before you, who are all trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fruit-bearing trees: What abundance of fruit did Chriſt bring forth to his Father, when he was upon earth? Every bough and every branch be full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruit. To ſee <hi>the Glory of the only begotten Son, full of grace and truth.</hi> See Rev. 22. what is ſpoken there of this fruitful tree; and it's Chriſt that is this tree, the tree of life. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life.</hi> Oh what a fruitful tree is this tree of Life! He brings forth fruit every Month; continually full of fruit, and all that was in Chriſt was uſeful; the very leaves are good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the very leaves of this tree of Life were good. Oh the precious balm that dropt from the leaves of this tree of life, into poor afflicted and wounded Souls! The <hi>very leaves of it were good for the healing of the Nations:</hi> And it was <hi>Jobs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and it was alſo his comfort, when the hand of the Lord was upon him, that he brought forth fruit, that he was a fruit-bearing tree, <hi>Job 29. 11. When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me, and when the eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me:</hi> and as the ear and eye bleſſed him, ſo the loins bleſſed him, <hi>Job 31. 20. the loins of the Poor bleſſed him,</hi> that he warmed and that he refreſhed: So that this was a great comfort unto <hi>Job,</hi> in the day of his diſtreſs, when all his friends upbraided him with hypocriſie, he knew that grace would uphold him, he was not an unfruitful tree, but was ſtill ſerviceable in the place and relation God had ſet him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Nay let me further tell you, that if Chriſtians be not fruit-bearing trees, they are a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Chriſt; it's a diſhonour to the very root they profeſs they are engrafted upon. When you come to a tree whoſe branches are dead and withered, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42593:19"/> you ſee there is no fruit upon it, you will complain preſently, and ſay there is ſome fault in the root; the fruit is dry and withered, the unfruitful branches are a diſhonour to the root. Unfruitful Chriſtians are a dishonour to Chriſt. Oh! What will the world ſay, when they come to look upon Chriſtians, when they ſee they are dry, withered, and fruitleſs, and there is no more to be ſeen in them than in others? What ſayes the world? why, the blame is caſt upon their head, the root: theſe are the Chriſtians, theſe are the profeſſors. Oh wherein do men take occaſion? Oh give no juſt occaſion for men to ſpeak diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of Chriſt whom you profeſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Again it's the diſhonour of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to have an unfruitful tree, <hi>Joh. 15. 1. I am the vine, and my Father is the Husbandman: every branch in me that beareth no fruit, he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and every branch that beareth fruit he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it that it may bring forth more fruit:</hi> and ſo when the Gardener, the Husbandman, ſhall let a tree ſtand forty years, and be unfruitful, this man will be accounted unskilful in his Vineyard: Why, ſo if the Lord ſhould let ſuch trees to ſtand forty, fifty or a hundred years, and no fruit brought to him, it's a great dishonour to the husbandman.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Therefore again ſecondly, Chriſtians ſhould look that their fruit be the fruit of the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, be like to Chriſt: in this, he was as the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree among the trees of the wood: You know the Apple-tree is known by the ſmoothneſs of the branches; it's not full of pricks and Thorns, as many other trees are; It will not ſcratch, it will not tear or rend, as others will, though men break the branches, and ſpoil them, yet it doth not tear or rend them: and truly thus was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42593:19"/> Chriſtians to be; He was no thorn, he was beſet with thorns, <hi>Iſaiah 53. 7. he was oppreſſed, he was dumb, he opened not his mouth: as a Sheep that is dumb before his ſhearer:</hi> he did not revile, he did not render reviling for reviling, he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the ſmoaking flax he did not quench, nor break the bruiſed reed, he did not ſtrive, he did not cry, his voice was not heard in the ſtreets; and thus was Chriſt, and thus it becomes Chriſtians. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not tear and rend; they ſhould not bear pricking thorns; they ſhould not render evil for evil, they ſhould not pour forth expreſſions of hatred, envy and wrath. This is for the bryar and the thorn; this is not for the Apple-tree. If you be Apple-trees, be like to Chriſt in this. But,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Again the Apple-tree is known by the fruit. There's a great deal of fruit that is like the fruit of the Apple-tree, that is not known till ſuch time as men come to taſte it. It's poſſible that a wild tree may be as fair and as beautiful as the Apple-tree; but when you come to taſte it, you will diſtinguiſh the fruit of the wild tree; the Crab-tree, it's ſowr, it's bitter; the fruit of the Apple-tree is ſweet and pleaſant. Brethren, know, God doth examine all your fruit and all the Apples, and God doth taſte every fruit,</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, by the Principle, and ſecondly, by mens End.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, The Lord doth taſte mens fruit by their principle; he examines from whence men brought forth their fruit, whence came their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: he examines whether they were grafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good ſtock or no; the Lord knows it I ſay by the taſte: when you take a twig, or cyon and graft it on an Elder, or ſome other tree that hath an ill
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42593:20"/> taſte, the fruit will taſte as the tree is: If it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted upon a good ſtock, the fruit will be good; the Lord will examine every mans ſtock, whether he be engrafted on Chriſt or on himſelf. See <hi>Hoſea 14. 8. I am like a green firr tree</hi> (the words of Chriſt) <hi>and from me is all thy fruit found.</hi> That's good fruit that grows upon Chriſt, that comes from Chriſt, that taſtes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>When doth a mans fruit taſte of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt of all; When the Soul is ſtill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to get out of it ſelf, is ſtill emptying it ſelf, getting out of himſelf: when a man doth all that he can do; and yet looks upon himſelf as vile, and wretched, abhorring himſelf in duſt and aſhes; when he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſayes, there is nothing at all in him that is good. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes it: that is his expreſſion, and it was the expreſſion of a gracious heart, <hi>Rom. 7. 18. For I know that in me (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> When the Soul is thus taken up (with <hi>Paul</hi>) emptying it ſelf, and looking upon it ſelf as a poor vile, weak, wretched creature, utterly unable to do any thing in his own ſtrength for God, and lying at the footſtool of Chriſt, breathing and waiting; this fruit is not of himſelf, but it taſtes of Chriſt. But again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, the fruit taſtes of Chriſt, when as the ſoul doth all out of a principle of <hi>Faith.</hi> It works from a principle of faith: It hath ſeen the tenders of grace in the Goſpel, how the Lord doth freely and graciouſly hold forth himſelf to poor loſt ſinners; and hath through the power of God made a cloſe with his tender of grace, received it by faith, ſo that now this faith it works by love; and all that ever the Soul doth, it deſires to do it out of love to God;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42593:20"/> when it comes thus from a principle of faith, it doth alway act by love, then the Soul taſtes and feeds upon Chriſt. But again,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, the Soul taſtes of Chriſt, when it lives from a continual dependance on Chriſt; when the Soul goes only out to Chriſt for righteouſneſs and ſtrength and Salvation; when it goes out to Chriſt for all grace, ſtrength and Holineſs; for ſtrength to perform every duty, and to bear every burden; and to walk wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graciouſly in every relation; when the Soul lyes breathing and waiting upon Chriſt (as the Poor man in the Goſpel, who laid at the pool of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda,</hi>) when the ſoul lies waiting for the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and is continually opening its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory affections to Chriſt; looks upon it ſelf as a Ship at ſea in a Calm, and is not able to ſtir, unleſs the wind move, unleſs the wind blow; I ſay when the ſoul doth thus act, this fruit taſtes of Chriſt; and thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> profeſs that he lived in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dependance upon Chriſt, and that all that he did, it was not from himſelf or any thing of his own, but it was from Chriſt: See that place in the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> from which a gracious Spirit doth breath, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I am Crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the Life which I live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> Here's a gracious expreſſion, <hi>I live,</hi> ſayes he, and <hi>yet not I, it's Chriſt that lives in me.</hi> When the ſoul can thus refer all to Chriſt, and, ſayes, I believe, and <hi>it's not I but Chriſt that helps me,</hi> and ſo <hi>I obey, yet not I,</hi> but it's the Spirit of Chriſt in me; and <hi>I ſuffer, yet not I,</hi> but Chriſt ſtrengthening me; I pray and I perform duties, and yet not I, but it's the Spirit of Chriſt in me, that breaths in me; when the ſoul
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42593:21"/> thus goes out of it ſelf, and depends upon Chriſt for all grace and ſtrength, and all Holineſs, as well as for life and Salvation, now doth the fruit of this Soul taſte of Chriſt, God knows it, he taſtes of Chriſt in it. But then again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, As God doth taſte of the principles of the Soul as by the Stock from whence it comes, ſo alſo by the ends of it. What's the end of a mans action, what is the end of that he doth for God, what is the end of his affections, of his forwardneſs, of his duties? the Lord judgeth of all the fruit by the ends of it; why, if the Glory of God be a mans end in all that he doth, this taſtes of the fruit of Chriſt, of the fruit of the Apple-tree; but if a man aim at his own ends, if a man ſeek himſelf in all that he doth, it taſtes ſtrong of Self, and the Lord hath no delight in it; ſee what is ſaid in <hi>Hoſea 10. 1. Iſrael is an emptie Vine,</hi> and <hi>yet he brings forth fruit;</hi> how can theſe two ſtand together? he brings forth fruit, but he brings forth no good fruit, he is emptie becauſe he is empty to God, he brings forth fruit and that fruit is emptie, it's <hi>to himſelf,</hi> and ſo emptie: and ſo God looks upon him as an emptie Vine; if a man bring forth never ſo much fruit, (it being to himſelf) it can't be called good, but ſeemleſs fruit, and all that fruit is loſt, the Lord takes no delight in that fruit, it's not for Gods taſte, when as it's not brought forth unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, when doth a man bring forth fruit to God? What are the ends that a man ſhould propound to himſelf in all his actions to God, that makes his fruit to be good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the Soul doth all that it doth, that it may teſtifie its thankfulneſs that it owes to God for the great and wonderful ſalvation that comes in by Chriſt; when a man ſayes, <hi>I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of God;</hi> When a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42593:21"/> man does all that he doth to teſtifie his Subjection to God, and only does all his works that he may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and lift up Gods name in the world; that he may be ſerviceable and inſtrumental to do God ſervice in his generation, when he makes this his end: when a man ſhall do all for this end, that God may reap the Glory, that God may eat of the fruit he hath planted, that God may not loſe all his labour, and all his pains, and all his coſt; that ſo he that hath planted the tree in his Orchard, may eat the fruit of it; ſo that when a man makes not himſelf the end, but God the ſole end, this God taſtes of as ſavourie, as a fruit ſavoury to himſelf. But again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Chriſtians ſhould labour to bring forth much of this fruit; a good tree brings forth much fruit: Oh how full was Chriſt! every bough was full of fruit: Therefore the people of God, they are compared unto trees that are planted by the rivers ſide, it's ſaid, <hi>they ſhall be as trees planted by the rivers of waters:</hi> they are fruitful trees that are well watered, and ſo bring forth abundance of fruit; Oh Chriſtians, remember this was the end of Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>that you may bring forth fruit, and bring forth abundance of fruit;</hi> you ſhould not only be trees, but bring forth abundance of fruit. <hi>I came that you might have life; and that you might have it more abundantly:</hi> See that promiſe and make much of it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92. it's a gracious promiſe, and may tend through the bleſſing of God to quicken dead unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts, <hi>v. 12, 13. the righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palm tree: he ſhall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon; thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, they ſhall bring forth fruit in old age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing:</hi> it's a large promiſe, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42593:22"/> and they ſhall bring forth fruit in old age; therefore you that complain of the deadneſs, and unfruitfulneſs of your hearts, look to the promiſe, and ſay, Oh Lord I have a dead heart, my branches are withered, I even deſpair of bringing forth fruit to God; why, don't look to thy own deadneſs, look to the promiſe of God: It's ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he had a dead body, or as good as dead in reſpect of begetting Children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. yet he lookt to the promiſe, <hi>v. 19, 20. And being not weak in faith he conſidered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old, neither the deadneſs of Sarahs womb: he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in Faith giving glory to God,</hi> he had a dead body, and yet his faith was revived: when he lookt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, he was confident that God who had promiſed was able to perform: and thou that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt of the deadneſs of thy heart, don't look upon thine own heart, but upon the promiſe, God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his faithfulneſs and whatſoever he hath promiſed he will fulfill it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, how ſhould we believe it? we ſee the contrary: how is this promiſe made good that the righteous ſhall bring forth fruit in old age? don't we ſee many times how the beſt Chriſtians decay in old age? which makes us even afraid to live to old age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Certainly the promiſe of God is made good, they do flouriſh, and bring forth fruit in old age: an old Chriſtian, though he may not bring forth ſo much of ſome fruit, yet he brings forth more of other fruit, than young Chriſtians do; it may be there is not ſo much Zeal, nor ſo much activitie for God, ay, but there may be more rootedneſs, more ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more eſtabliſhment of heart; the heart may be more rooted, more grounded upon him: this makes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42593:22"/> the fruit the more ſavoury: the leſs of Self, and the more of Chriſt is in him, the more well pleaſing is it to Gods taſte. Now I ſay that old Chriſtians (it's true) may decay in parts and gifts, in utterance and expreſſion, and the like, and yet may not decay in grace: the inward man, the hidden man in the heart, that may wax ſtrong, and be more freſh, green and fruitful.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again I ſay to this that young Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may have more activitie, but old Chriſtians may have more Skill, and therefore though they may not act as formerly, yet there may be abundance of Skill in holy things; as the wiſe man ſayes, <hi>remember thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour before old age comes,</hi> before <hi>the daughters of muſick fall low,</hi> before the voice is gone; he was able it may be to ſing clear before, yet now he may have as much skill, and it may be more than ever though old; and ſo of an old Chriſtian, this may be ſaid, that young Chriſtians may bring forth more fruit, but old Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may bring forth ſweeter fruit; it's ſo of older trees, they bring forth ſweeter fruit, though not ſo much indeed as young trees: why, ſo, old Chriſtians that hold faſt in their Integritie, if they don't bring forth ſo much as the young tree, yet they bring forth ſweeter and pleaſanter fruit; and ſtill the Lord is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his promiſe, <hi>the righteous bring forth fruit in old age;</hi> and therefore look to the promiſe of the Lord, and let this promiſe ſtrengthen your faith.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Again, Labour to grow up in grace: the Lord loves to walk in his Orchard, when there are fruitful trees he loves to beſtow his pains upon them, he will hedge them, he will prune them, he will ſpare no coſt on his fruitful trees; nay the Lord will not cut down his fruitful trees, here's great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for Chriſtians to bring forth much fruit
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42593:23"/> in their Generation: God doth ſpare thoſe who bring forth much fruit: God gave command in the book of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> when as they went out to war, <hi>Deut. 20. 19 When thou ſhalt beſiege a City a long time, in making war againſt it, to take it, thou ſhalt not deſtroy the trees thereof, by forcing an ax againſt them, for thou mayeſt eat of them.</hi> For the trees of the Field might be imployed in the ſiege, the trees that brought forth no fruit, thoſe trees ſhould be cut down; but thoſe that bear fruit ſhall not (by Gods command) be cut down: you that are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing trees, the Lord takes ſpecial care of you, the Lord will not cut down thoſe trees: the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he comes and looks on a branch, and ſees no fruit, he is ready to cut it down; ay, but if there comes one and ſpies a cluſter on it, if it be but one cluſter, don't cut it down, ſurely it is not dead, here is a cluſter on it. Oh the grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God towards his people, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt found in ſuch, and therefore Lord cut them not down; thus mercy pleads: Well then, you that belong to Chriſt, bring forth much fruit. If you ask me how? I anſwer, look to God the great hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, he is ſuch a husbandman as he knows how to make you fruitful: <hi>Paul plants, and Apollo waters, but God gives the encreaſe;</hi> look to the Lord, be willing to ſubmit unto God in whatſoever way God ſhall deal with you, be willing that the Husbandman ſhould prune you, launce you, that he ſhould cut off your unſound branches; Submit unto Gods wayes of affliction, though they be never ſo hard, the Lord he can by them make you fruitful. The rain it makes wayes dirtie, but in time it makes grounds fruitful. The Lord he can make thy trees fruitful, and the herbs that he hath ſowen and planted in thy heart fruitful:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42593:23"/> therefore ſubmit unto Gods wayes, and get nigher to Chriſt as ever thou deſireſt to be fruitful; the branches that are neareſt the root, thoſe branches bring forth moſt fruit: Chriſt is the root, and you that are in Chriſt cleave more to him, and let your dependance be on him. The nigher you are to him, the more fruit you ſhall bring forth.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, The fourth and laſt thing and I have done, Let Chriſtians be like unto Chriſt in this, that they be Apple-trees in the midſt of the wood. Chriſt he was an Apple-tree among bryars and thorns in the world, Oh that Chriſtians would be like unto Chriſt in this: It was the great commendation of <hi>Lot, Enoch, Moſes, Joſiah, David,</hi> and others that lived in an evil age, yet their hearts were upright for God; and truly though their ſervices be hard ſervice, and though Gods people be in an evil world, yet in heaven they ſhall lift up God without oppoſition (and thought it be here with oppoſition, yet: ſtill it makes the Name of God Glorious; to bring forth fruit when all the world is unfruitful, or hath nothing but wild fruit, this is their commendation. There are ſome profeſſors, they will be Apple-trees among the Apple-trees, but when they are among the trees of the wood, then they'l be crab-trees; Chriſt though in the midſt of the wood he was ſweet and delightful fruit, though compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with ſinners; well, look unto Chriſt to keep up your ſavoury fruit, that God may taſte it, that you may ſtill bring forth ſweet and pleaſant fruit, though compaſſed about with Wild trees. And ſo much for this time.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>YOu heard in the former part of the verſe, that the Lord Jeſus is compared to an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree in the midſt of the trees of the wood; and I preſt it upon you the laſt day, that you ſhould be like unto Chriſt: Chooſe to be fruit-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees; it's better to be a fruitful tree than to be a tall Cedar or a mighty Oak; I proceed to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
            <p>You have heard of the tree: Now conſider the two reſemblances in which Chriſt is compared unto the Apple-tree. Here is a Specification, or an Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Simile. Firſt, Here is an <hi>Apple-tree</hi> for the nature; And ſecondly, for the fruit: ſo that theſe words hold forth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, How Beneficial Chriſt was, and how Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial he is as he is a tree. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, What uſe the believing ſoul makes of him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is beneficial for his ſhadow, that's delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42593:24"/> a pleaſant delightful ſhadow. Secondly, Then he is beneficial for his fruit, his fruit that is ſweet alſo: now the uſe that the believing Soul makes of Chriſt is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It ſits down under his ſhadow: <hi>I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight.</hi> Secondly, It eats of his fruit; <hi>His fruit was ſweet to my taſte:</hi> So that both his ſhadow and his fruit is exceeding pleaſant and delightful to the believing Soul.</p>
            <p>The words have two ſeveral readings: Some read them thus. In his ſhadow I delight and ſit down; I deſired and ſat down in his ſhadow: Or in his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow I deſired to ſit; I deſired that I might ſit down, for the word ſignifies both deſire and delight, now I take it ſo. I deſired that I might ſit down. It holds forth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, the <hi>Vehemence</hi> of affection which is in the believers heart to Chriſt, the mighty ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the breathings and pantings, the deſires of a gracious heart are carried out ſtrongly after Chriſt; <hi>Pſ.</hi> 42. 1, 2. they are the expreſſions of mighty ſtrong deſires, vehement deſires after God: <hi>as the hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo doth my Soul after thee, O God; my ſoul thirſts after God, for the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi> ſo, Iſa. 64. 1. the Church expreſſes her ſtrong deſires after God; <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt rent the heavens and that thou wouldſt come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy preſence:</hi> the expreſſions of vehement deſires after Chriſt, it's like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a Servant, or labouring Man after the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſo <hi>Job</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 2. he ſets down what deſire the labouring man hath: <hi>as a ſervant earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſireth the ſhadow, and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work,</hi> he thirſts after it, he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42593:25"/> breaths after it, when a man deſires and breaths after a thing he draws in the air, he ſucks and pants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, ſuch is the deſire of a poor Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not hold forth only vehemence of deſire, but it holds forth <hi>conſtancy</hi> of deſire, <hi>I deſire that I may ſit down:</hi> ſhe was ſat, but ſhe deſired to ſit ſtill, I deſire to ſit longer and to continue under the ſhadow, as a man that ſits under a ſhadowy place at eaſe, he is loth to be diſturbed: <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27. his deſires were like unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Spouſe here; <hi>v.</hi> 4. one thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord, <hi>and that will I ſeek after all the dayes of Life, to behold the beautie of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple: David</hi> deſired all his dayes to ſit under the Ordinance, that he might behold the beautie of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall look towards the other reading, which is more known: I ſat down under his ſhaddow with delight: Or I delighted and ſat down under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte. She had a great delight; as her deſires were ſtrong, ſo her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was good. When a Soul finds Chriſt, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way finds a Sweetneſs in him, which is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to all its deſires: It's not ſo in the things of the world: a man may have ſtrong deſires after vanities and creature comforts, but when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes them, he can take no delight in them; but it is not ſo in the enjoyment of Chriſt, the delight is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the deſire of the Soul; nay, it's more in Chriſt than it expected: it's able to ſay as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Solomon,</hi> I heard a great deal of thy wiſdom, ſaid ſhe, <hi>but the half was not told me.</hi> I ſhall clear up two things in the words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, ſhew you what this ſhadow is that the ſpouſe ſat under.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42593:25"/>2. Secondly, What is it to ſit under this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, What is the <hi>ſhadow the Spouſe ſat under with ſo much delight?</hi> they are either natural or metaphorical; you know what a natural ſhadow is, it's a darker or obſcurer light which is cauſed by the Interpoſition of your body betwixt the eye and the ſun, when the Trees or the Mountains ſtand betwixt you and the Sun, they caſt a ſhadow towards you; now there are ſhadows of the night, and ſhadows of the day: indeed night is nothing elſe but a ſhadow, a great ſhadow, nothing but the ſhadow of the earth, the earth coming betwixt the Sun and us, therefore the ſhadow: the night, it's a privation of light, and therefore it's terrible, the ſhadows of the night are dreadful to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture becauſe it's a privation of light: but the ſhadow of Chriſt is not the ſhadow of the night, for his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is no dreadful ſhadow, indeed it's like the ſhadow of the night for the largeneſs of it, becauſe the ſhadow that Chriſt caſts it reaches the whole earth over, it's a mighty large ſhadow, that thouſands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor weary ſouls may ſit under, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it reſembles the ſhadow of the night: but it's not the ſhadow of the night, it's a comfortable ſhadow, a delightful ſhadow, it's the ſhadow of the day, it's as the ſhadow of the trees, or as the ſhadow of a Rock in the midſt of Summer: as you know they are exceeding pleaſant and delightful. So then we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the uſe of theſe ſhadows, that we may ſee how uſeful Chriſt is to the Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, The uſe of the natural ſhadow it ſerves for Secrecy: If a man will hide himſelf, or retire himſelf, he will go among the ſhadows. A man that walks amongſt the woods and ſhadows, he is not ſo eaſily found, as when he walks in the open field, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42593:26"/> no trees, and ſo nothing to ſhadow him; and therefore the Lord is ſaid to ſhadow his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 16. I have put my word into thy mouth, and <hi>covered thee in the ſhadow of my hand,</hi> there I have hid thee, that thou mayſt be ſafe: and thus Beloved is Chriſt a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: Chriſt is a ſhadow to his people in that he is their hiding-place, they are hid in Chriſt, their life is hid in Chriſt, and their comforts are all hid in Chriſt, they are hid from wrath, they are hid from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, they are hid from enemies, they are hid from the power of temptation: and therefore God puts <hi>Moſes</hi> into the Rock, when he would hide him, which rock was a type of Chriſt: the Soul that is in Chriſt it lies in the rock, it lies in the clefts of the Rock, it's in Chriſt that the ſoul enjoyes ſweet Communion with God, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires it ſelf and hides it ſelf in Chriſt, and converſes ſweetly with the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, As the ſhadow is a place for ſecrecy, ſo a place for <hi>reſt;</hi> I ſay it's a place for reſt: When a man, a labouring man in the field, deſires to ſit down, he will ſit down under a ſhadow; the expreſſion of <hi>Job</hi> before, as the ſervant earneſtly <hi>deſires the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;</hi> why wherefore does he deſire the ſhadow, but that he might <hi>ſit down</hi> and <hi>reſt?</hi> there is nothing ſo welcome to him as a ſhadow, a ſhadowy place where he may ſit down and reſt: In this reſpect Chriſt is a ſhadow to his people, he is a ſweet reſting-place: it's not poſſible the ſoul ſhould reſt but in Chriſt, it never finds reſt till it come to Chriſt: therefore he calls, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 28. poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Souls, ſuch as are weary and tired, and have ſpent their labour and ſtrength in vain; Come to me, ſayes he, you that are weary and heavie laden, and <hi>I will give you reſt:</hi> the Soul does never reſt ſweetly till it come down and reſt ſweetly under Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, a ſhadow it's a place of <hi>coolneſs</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42593:26"/> and of <hi>refreſhment,</hi> it's a defence againſt the heat: if a man deſire to walk in the height of Summer, he will walk in the ſhadow; thus is Chriſt to his people. You ſhall ſee what is ſaid in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 2. And a man ſhall be as a hiding-place from the wind, as a covert from the tempeſt, as a river of water in a dry place, <hi>as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary Land: as the ſhadow of a great rock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which keeps off the heat and the ſcorching of the Sun; and thus is Chriſt to a poor Soul, a poor fainting Soul, that is ſcorched with the heat and diſpleaſure of the Lord, why there is no ſitting down but under Chriſt. When the Soul ſits down under wrath and diſpleaſure, he makes every place too hot, and every condition too hot, and there is no ſitting down under any creature comfort; a man can't ſit down under the ſhadow of any creature, or under the ſhadow of himſelf, or under the ſhadow of his own righteouſneſs, the Sun of wrath will be too hot for him, he will ſoon ſet all the ſtraw and ſtubble on fire, there is no reſt there, and it can't ſit down untill it come to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Again, To ſit down with Chriſt there is Contemplation and Meditation; for a man to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his thoughts and meditation he will chooſe a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy place: the Lord Chriſt he is thus a ſhadow. When the Soul ſits under Chriſt, it may contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the glory of God that is in Chriſt. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals precious things, excellent things to his people, ſuch as eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard, nor the heart of man can conceive; the ſoul ſits down under Chriſt, and it gains more of the knowledge of God in one day, than in many years: all the knowledge that God gives of himſelf, it's in, and through Chriſt. God gives knowledge, ſayes the Apoſtle, but <hi>it's in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I ſay whilſt the Soul ſits
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42593:27"/> under Chriſt, it's under a ſhadow, and it may contemplate on the great things of the Kingdom of God, and is learnt to know that which is hid from the wiſe and prudent of the world. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, We are wont to uſe the ſhadow for a place of refreſhing our ſelves, eating and drinking under it. It was uſual among the Patriarchs in thoſe hot contryes: the Angels when they came to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he deſired them to ſit under a tree, and made proviſion ready, and there they did eat; and thus is Chriſt uſeful unto his people, whilſt they ſit under Chriſt, they feed upon precious fruit; I ſat under his ſhadow, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte, under God in Chriſt. God doth make a ſweet Banquet for the Soul, and the ſoul, though it enjoys many promiſes, and never ſo many precious ordinances, yet unleſs the ſoul ſits under the ſhadow of Chriſt, it can't feed upon them, it can take no delight in them. If a man have never ſo good meat, in the height of Summer, if he hath no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to keep off the Scorching beams of the Son, he can't eat his meat with delight. So the ſoul if it looks not upon God in Chriſt, as he is a ſhadow to him, it can't partake of any of that daintie with delight.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, Again, You know a man can't look upon the beautie and light of the Sun with eaſe, it is ſo Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as it ſpoils the ſenſe: but if a man look through the trees, or the ſhade he may ſee the ſun: and thus the Lord he doth cauſe the Soul to ſee Chriſt, and thus the ſoul it beholds his Glory; <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face and live.</hi> But thus I will do, I will put thee in the Rock, and ſo thou ſhalt ſee ſome glimpſe of Glory. It's in and through Chriſt that the Soul ſees ſomething of God, for he could not elſe behold his Glory, for our God is a conſuming fire; thus you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42593:27"/> ſee what the natural ſhadow is, ſo is Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, There are Metaphorical ſhadows: ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in Scripture is taken in a Metaphorical ſence: the ſhadow is taken for a <hi>defence;</hi> as they that ſit under protection, are ſaid to ſit under a ſhadow. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 3. Wo to the rebellious Children, ſaith the Lord, that take counſel but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add ſin to ſin: that walk to go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have not asked at my mouth, to ſtrengthen themſelves in the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to truſt in the <hi>ſhadow of Egypt.</hi> Therefore ſhall the ſtrength of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be your ſhame; and the truſt <hi>in the ſhadow of Egypt your confuſion.</hi> God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wo to them that run down to <hi>Egypt;</hi> you ſee there that ſtrength and ſhadow is all one, they truſt in the ſtrength of <hi>Egypt:</hi> under the ſhadow of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is the ſtrength of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They thought that <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould have been their protection: ſo <hi>Pſa.</hi> 17. when <hi>David</hi> prayes that the Lord would protect him, he prays that the Lord would be a <hi>ſhadow</hi> to him; there protection and ſhadow is all one. Verſe 8. keep me as the Apple of thine eye, <hi>hide me under the ſhadow of thy Wings:</hi> Now if you take ſhadow in this Metaphorical ſence, for <hi>defence</hi> and protection, it's very evident that Chriſt is thus a ſhadow unto his people, he is their defence and protection: It's he that defends them from the wrath of God, and it's he that defends them from the wrath of man. It's ſaid of ſome trees, the Laurel tree and ſome other, they are a defence unto men in a tempeſt of thunder and Lightening. However it's true of Chriſt. He that ſits under Chriſt, he is a defence from thunder and lightening, from the wrath of God, and that Soul that ſtands under him he is ſafe and well protected.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42593:28"/>
            <p>And as he is a defence to man from the wrath of God, ſo he is a defence from the wrath of man; <hi>Iſa. 4. 6. And there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day-time from the heat; and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from ſtorm and from rain.</hi> The Lord Chriſt promiſeth protection unto his people in the day time, when it's never ſo hot, when the wrath of man is fierce and cruel: and there is a like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the 25. of the ſame prophecie, 4. verſe, For thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needie in his diſtreſs, <hi>a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord Chriſt he is ſuch a ſhadow, ſuch a protection to his people againſt the heat and tempeſt of all wrathfull ones.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, A ſhadow in the Metaphorical ſenſe, it ſignifies <hi>afflictions</hi> and ſorrows, and ſometimes <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, becauſe they are privations of comfort, even as the ſhadow is a privation of light, and theſe may be called Chriſts ſhadows: the ſufferings of Chriſt are Chriſts ſhadows: It was the ſufferings of Chriſt that did eclipſe his glory when he was here upon earth: now all theſe ſhadows theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, though they were dreadful ſhadows to him, yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſhadows to his people from firſt to laſt; all the ſufferings of Chriſt are comfortable ſhadows to his people. He ſat under them with abundance of grief and dolour, that ſo his people might ſit under him with abundance of joy and peace and comfort; his temptations were all ſore griefs. Oh what a day of temptation was it to him? And yet how comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table were theſe ſufferings unto his people? Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even Death it ſelf, was a ſhadow to Chriſt, and what a comfortable refreſhing was it to his people! When Chriſt was upon the Croſs he caſt a great ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42593:28"/> and what comfortable refreſhment is it for poor weary Souls to ſit under it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, The ſhadow in a Metaphorical ſence in Scripture is a dark repreſentation of a thing; that which doth repreſent a thing, it's called the ſhadow of it; as you know the types and Ceremonies and the whole Levitical Law, they did hold forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt, and therefore all thoſe ceremonies and types they were <hi>ſhadows of things to come,</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of all thoſe ceremonial things, they were the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> but the body is Chriſt. So then whatever it is that holds forth Chriſt, whatſoever it is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſt to the ſoul, that may be called a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, the ſhadow of Chriſt under which the Soul ſits down, which the Soul takes delight in. As all the Ordinances of Chriſt they hold forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt; as a mans picture is called a ſhadow; the ordinances, they hold forth Chriſt, there's the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt in them. The word holds forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt, and ſo the Sacrament, and ſo the fellowſhip of the ſaints, there's ſomething of Chriſt to be found in all theſe, to be ſeen and enjoyed in all theſe: this alſo is one of the ſhadows of Chriſt that a gracious heart deſires to ſit under; where ever it ſees any thing of Chriſt, in any word, any Ordinance, in any Communion of ſaints, there it takes delight, it bleſſes God for ſuch communications of himſelf, and there it ſits down, deſiring with all faithfulneſs to wait upon God in them, that it may ſee more of Chriſt until ſuch time as the day ſhall break and the ſhadows may flie away. Thus you may ſee what this ſhadow is that the believing ſoul deſires to ſit under, and how Chriſt is likened and ſet forth by the Natural and Metaphorical ſhadow.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42593:29"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay in the next place, <hi>What is it to ſit down under this ſhadow?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt of all, It's a <hi>Poſture of reſt,</hi> as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a moving poſture, ſo ſitting is a poſture of reſt; It holds forth, the ſoul is in a reſtleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till ſuch time as it comes to Chriſt, there is no reſt till ſuch time as it pitches upon Chriſt: what ſayes <hi>David,</hi> in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he ſpeaks unto his Soul there, when he deſired that he might return to his reſt, <hi>Pſalm 116. 7. Now Oh my ſoul return unto thy reſt,</hi> for the Lord he hath dealt bountifully with me: he had been wandring abroad in the world, and he found no reſt there, he returns to God as to his reſting-place, and <hi>now Oh my ſoul return unto thy reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Again, Secondly, it's <hi>a reſt with Confidence;</hi> as it's a reſting Poſture, ſo it's <hi>a Confident Poſture.</hi> A man will not ſit down in a place of danger, if he ſees danger he will not ſit down: If a man be in ſuch a place as he fears wild beaſts or thieves, he will not ſit down: why, when a man ſits it's a confident Poſture; to ſit down with Chriſt, it's a confident Poſture, it's to truſt in Chriſt, when the ſoul layes all its weight upon Chriſt, when it looks to the power, goodneſs and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord Jeſus, held forth in the promiſe, there it ſits and ventures it ſelf upon him, and ſaith with the Apoſtle, I know in whom I have truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and believed, and <hi>he is able to keep what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his truſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Again, ſitting it's a poſture of <hi>ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> when a man leans or reſts upon another he is ready to fall down, but this holds forth the ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſouls condition in Chriſt. Oh then it's not poſſible the Soul ſhould fall; he may be moved, but he ſhall not be greatly moved; he may be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42593:29"/> moved ſo as not to be removed; <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,</hi> nay twice he hath made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Again, Fourthly and laſtly, This poſture doth relate to <hi>continuance and abiding;</hi> and therefore that eternity of enjoyment of Chriſt is ſet down with that eternity of reſt with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of God. If a man ſit down, he will make ſome ſtay, it holds forth a continuance, or abiding of the ſoul with Chriſt, there it reſolves to ſtay, there it reſolves to take up; as the Lord ſayes unto his people, <hi>here ſhall be my reſt for ever;</hi> ſo ſays the ſoul, Lord here I will reſt, here I will abide and continue for ever. Well then, to conclude all with a word of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt of all, it lets us ſee, whatſoever is in Chriſt is uſeful and delightful. Every paſſage of the life of Chriſt, yea all the ſufferings of Chriſt, from firſt to laſt, how uſeful are they to the Saints, and how comfortable when they are improved by faith? Not only the fruit of the Tree is good, but the ſhadow of the Tree is good, the very ſhadow of Chriſt is good, the ſufferings of Chriſt, the very death of Chriſt is exceeding uſeful and delightful, when the Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in it: Oh how delightful is the Glory of Chriſt!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> But in a word I beſeech you ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts ſhadow, let not any Poor creature ſit down under any other ſhadow but the ſhadow of Chriſt. Make haſte, poor weary Souls, you that have toyled your ſelves, and laboured in vain, have ſought for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and conſolation in your ſelves, Oh that you would not think of ſitting down under theſe ſhadows: But make haſte to Chriſt, get out of your ſelves and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42593:30"/> ſit under his ſhadow. Let me tell you if you be not under this ſhadow of Chriſt, you are under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death; It's ſaid of Chriſt before he came into the Land of <hi>Napthali,</hi> they ſat down under the region <hi>and ſhadow of Death:</hi> ſo Poor Souls, if you ſit not under Chriſts ſhadow, you ſit under the very region of the ſhadow of death.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me tell you further that it's not poſſible you ſhould find reſt, but only under this ſhadow; there is no creature can ſhadow you: the ſhadow of your own righteouſneſs and your own works is too ſhort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you, and the ſhadow of all the works that men do enjoy they are too ſhort. A man may ſolace himſelf under the ſhadow of the creature for a time, theſe ſhadows are too ſhort when the Sun gets up to the height of it's beauty, and you have moſt need of ſhadow you can't have it. Poor Souls, when you have moſt need of cool refreſhing ſhadows, theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows goe quite away; ſo that I ſay it's not poſſible that you ſhould reſt ſweetly and ſecurely under any other ſhadows but the ſhadow of Chriſt, it's not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ye ſhould hold out in the time of trial: you read of the ſtony ground in <hi>Math.</hi> 13. the corn that was ſown upon it, when it came up, the Sun did ariſe, and though it did ſpring up, yet anon it withered, there was no root, and ſo it died: if Chriſt had been their ſhadow he could have helpt it, but when the wrath of man was furious he could not ſtand long, but withered, becauſe he had not depth of root: Oh what a ſweet refreſhing ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is Chriſt! if he do overſhadow the Soul, it may ſtand in any place, in any condition, though times of Perſecution be never ſo hot. You know Chriſt was a ſhadow in the fiery furnace, a ſweet refreſhing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42593:30"/> ſhadow to the three Children, there he kept off the heat.</p>
            <p>Nay, Conſider further, all the ſhadows beſides Chriſt are periſhing, they are vaniſhing ſhadows; they are truly compared unto ſhadows; man walks in a vain ſhadow; whatever any man ſits down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he ſits under a vain ſhadow, it flyes away preſently: you know the Prophet ſays, all fleſh is graſs, and the glory of it as the flower in the field, and what man would ſit down under the ſhadow of graſs? it's ſoon withered, and then the ſhadow is gone. What man will ſit down under withering comforts? they are cut down in a moment: and what are theſe ſhadows? All creature comforts are like the ſhadow of <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd, it was a good refeſhing ſhadow while he had it, but the Lord prepared a worm, and it did eat the Gourd before the Morning, and when the Sun did ariſe it did ſcorch the head of <hi>Jonah,</hi> and made him faint and ſick: why, ſo the Lord he doth ſerve Poor creatures like <hi>Jonah,</hi> when the creature is gone and the ſhadow is gone, when a man apprehends the wrath of the Lord, and the diſpleaſure of God, he hath nothing to ſhadow it; Oh what a hard affliction is this! what dangerous ſhadows are creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſit down under, which are prickling thorns and brambles? A man to ſit down under thorns when he might as well ſit down under the Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree: all creature comforts when a man ſits down under them, if truſted in, they will prove tearing thorns, pricking thorns, and nothing but ſorrow in them; now Chriſt he is a ſhadow wherein you may reſt, you may reſt upon Chrirſt and lean upon Chriſt, and he is of Infinite ſweet refreſhing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42593:31"/> and ſupport unto his people: take heed I ſay that you ſit not down under the ſhadow of any creature comfort, but under Chriſt, and then this will follow, you ſhall ſit down under him with ſweet delight, and ſhall eat of his fruit, and this fruit will be ſweet to your taſte. But ſo much for this time.</p>

            <p>A word of Inſtruction. You ſee that every thing that is in Chriſt is very uſeful; not ſo much as the ſhadow of Chriſt is uſeleſs: and if the ſhadow be ſo uſeful and deſirable, what is the tree it ſelf, and what is the fruit that this tree brings forth? And if ſo, then by way of caution, I ſay, take heed of ſitting under the ſhadow of any one creature comfort. He that is not under the ſhadow of Chriſt, he is under the ſhadow of Death. It's a poor ſhadow that all creature comforts afford, it's a ſhadow that will not continue when the Sun ſhall break forth at noon day. You know the natural ſhadow it goes up when the Son is at the higheſt, and when men have moſt need of the ſhadow, the ſhadow goes up, and thus is the ſhadow of all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42593:32"/> creature comforts: in times of affliction, in times of diſtreſs when men have moſt need of them, then the ſhadow of creature comforts leaves them; but now Chriſts ſhadow it's always refreſhing, it continues even at noon day, he makes his flock to reſt at noon day. It's not poſſible for the Soul to hold out in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, if it ſits not under Chriſts ſhadow: the ſtony ground is ſoon withered, why, becauſe Chriſt did not overſhadow it. Well then, I ſhall proceed to an uſe of Exhortation, and that is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt, To ſpeak to ſuch as are ſtrangers to Chriſt, to ſuch as for the preſent ſit under the ſhadow of Death, and under the ſhadow of Hell and deſtruction. Oh that the Lord would perſwade your hearts to come and ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt! Poor ſinners, you that are working the works of the Devil, you that are drudges to Satan, and your luſts, the baſe luſts of your own hearts, you that have a long time wearied your ſelves in the ſervice of ſin, and ſpent your labour as the Prophet ſpeaks, for that which cannot ſatisfie; Oh that you would not be content to be perpetual drudges to Satan. The Devil hath been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make you drudges, be not you willing to make your ſelves everlaſting drudges; Oh bethink of ſome reſting-place where you may ſit down and reſt from this labour, from this bondage of Satan; it may be whilſt you are under the purſuit of ſin, you are not ſenſible of it, you are not ſenſible of thoſe labours, pains and travails of the Soul. It fares with the poor ſinner as it fairs with a labouring man or a ſervant that is over-wrought; it may be (eſpecially if he be uſed to it) he feels it not whilſt he is in it, he feels not the ach, nor the evil of it; but when the evening comes, when he lies down for reſt, he feels then the fruit of his former labour and travail in his bones; and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42593:32"/> truly ſo it is with many a ſinner, whilſt they are in the purſuit of ſin, they feel not the pain, they feel not the ach, ay but the time is coming, the evening is coming, the night is coming, when they muſt lie down, when they can no longer go on, when they muſt whether they will or no reſt from that Labour; then certainly they will find and feel the ſmart of their former drudgery and bondage in their Spirit: Our Lord Jeſus made that an argument, <hi>John 9. 4. I muſt work the works of him that ſent me whilſt it's day: The night cometh when no man can work;</hi> but let me ſay the contrary to you, Oh don't work the works of Satan whilſt it's day, do not work the works of ſin all the day long, the night comes when you muſt ceaſe the labour of ſin, and then of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you will feel the ſmart of your pains and former ſervices in ſin; Oh then that the Lord would help you to conſider when you ſhall have a reſting place, when you ſhall ſit down and reſt your Souls, before the ſtrength of your Spirits be ſpent in the labour of ſin: Let me ſpeak this word in your ear and tell you, the Lord Jeſus is willing that you ſhould ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhadow, here's a ſweet cool refreſhing reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place for you to take up in: And let me ſay further for your incouragement to come under this ſhadow,</p>
            <p>That the Lord Jeſus, he will keep you for the future; he will be a defence to you, that your old Maſter ſhall not take you away again, and the Soul whom Chriſt hath taken to himſelf is free from the bondage of ſin, and if the Son make you free you ſhall be free indeed: if you ſit under any ſhadow but Chriſt, the Devil, your luſts and your own hearts will fetch you back again: it may be you have ſat down under your good works, vows, reſolutions, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42593:33"/> and repentances, and the like, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, the Devil and the corruption of your own hearts have fetcht you back again to the old ſlavery, and to the old bondage. Oh that you would truſt this ſhadow of Chriſt, this is ſuch a ſhadow as Satan dare not come nigh; it's the ſhadow of the day, it's not the ſhadow of the night, it's ſuch a ſhadow as is dreadful unto the powers of darkneſs. <hi>What have we to do with thee,</hi> ſaith the unclean Spirit, <hi>thou art the ſon of the living God;</hi> of a certain Chriſt will be a defence unto you, and a protection, and you ſhall not ſit under your former ſlaverie and bondage, if once you ſit under his ſhadow; Oh then that you would not toil your Spirits in the ſervice of ſin and Satan: Oh what a racking of the conſcience and ſoul have poor ſinners in the Service of Satan! They are ready to ſweat drops of water and blood, and they are not aware of it. Oh why will you tire your ſelves in the heat, and wearie and tire your ſelves, when as you might ſit down under ſuch a pleaſant ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as the ſhadow of Jeſus Chriſt is?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Secondly, Let me ſpeak a word to Poor Souls that are ſenſible of their bondage and miſery by reaſon of ſin, to ſuch as cry out with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſam 38. 4. for mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as an heavy burden they are too heavie for me.</hi> Oh you ſay, you have travailed in the wilderneſs, and have ſet many a weary ſtep in a dry and barren wilderneſs where no water is, and never a tree for a ſhadow to ſhelter you; you dare ſit down under the ſhadow of your own comforts and the creatures righteouſneſs, you ſee there is no ſhelter but under the ſhadow of the Almighty. Well, let me tell you here's a tree of life that ſprings up in this your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, that caſts a ſhadow over your Souls, here
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42593:33"/> you may reſt in a cool ſhadow, here will be a defence and a protection from the wrath of the Almighty. And let me ſay (for your incouragement) unto you,</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, That Chriſt is <hi>willing</hi> you ſhould ſit under his ſhadow, you have his own word for it, ſee what he ſpeaks in <hi>Math. 11. 28. Come to me all you that labour and are heavie laden, and I will give you reſt:</hi> Why do you ſtick ſo long in that condition, why do you ſay you are not laden enough? you know not whether your ſpirits be laden aright or no, or whether you be made ſenſible enough of ſin, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you may be ſo bold, as to come to Chriſt, and ſit under this his ſhadow.</p>
            <p>Chriſt doth not offer himſelf upon any conditions, upon the condition of your wearineſs, It's not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſe, but it's an abſolute promiſe, it's a ſweet incouraging promiſe, <hi>come unto me you that are wearie,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>and I will give you reſt.</hi> The Lord Jeſus foreſaw that they were moſt apt to be diſcouraged, poor labouring Souls, ſuch as were preſt with the guilt and burden of ſin, and he knew that they were ſuch as were fearful in coming in unto him, but ſays he, <hi>come ye that are laden and wearie, and I will give you reſt,</hi> but then,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again, The Lord Jeſus he is not only willing that you ſhould ſit under his ſhadow, but he will be a defence unto you under this ſhadow; you ſay you are hunted and purſued by Satan, you are hunted with wrath, Oh then that you would flee unto Chriſt, go now and ſit under his ſhadow, there is no other ſhadow can defend you but this ſhadow of Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> you know he ran away from God when he was guiltie, he goes and runs his head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the buſhes, but the Lord found him out; there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42593:34"/> is no creature can be your defence. What ſays the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Pſal. 139. 7. Thou haſt beſet me behind and before,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence?</hi> there's no place of ſafetie but only in this ſhadow of Chriſt; and he is a ſure defence; If it ſhould rain Storms of fire and Brimſtone, if once in Chriſt, this ſhadow will keep off all the heat of wrath, for he is a ſafe and ſure defence. Nay let me ſay,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Further for your incouragement, The Lord Jeſus he will not <hi>deal Treacherouſly</hi> with you when you turn in unto him: If you take under his ſhadow, he will not deal treacherouſly with you; when you flee from the purſuit of your enemy, he will <hi>reſcue, ſave and deliver:</hi> The Lord Jeſus he will not deal treacherouſly with thoſe that come under his ſhadow, there is no drop of wrath ſhall fall from this tree to thoſe that are under his ſhadow; the Lord Jeſus he never made any prey upon Poor creatures that turn in to him for ſhadow and reſt.</p>
            <p>Ay but will he not betray me into the hands of others, of thoſe that ſeek my ſoul to deſtroy it?</p>
            <p>No certainly, Chriſt will not deal ſo with you, his honour is engaged to the contrary. You know what <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid concerning thoſe two ſtrangers that came in to him, when they came to him for ſhadow, he would not deliver them, he would let go his life firſt, <hi>Gen. 19. 8. for therefore came they under the ſhadow of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my roof.</hi> When they came under his ſhadow for protection, <hi>Lot</hi> would not be ſo baſe as to betray them. He tells them he hath two Daughters that are undefiled, and he will rather deliver them into their hands than he will deliver thoſe ſtrangers, who took ſhelter under his roof: why, ſo ſays Chriſt, if wrath ſhouſd demand you or juſtice ſhould demand you, I will not let you go, he will rather ſay, let my Daughters go for it, my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42593:34"/> body or Soul go for it, rather than they ſhall go my ſelf ſhall go for it: thus Poor diſconſolate Souls, you ſee Chriſt he will not betray you unto thoſe who ſeek your Souls to deſtroy them. But</p>
            <p>3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Again, Thirdly, a word to thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt: Oh that you would make more uſe of this ſhadow of Jeſus Chriſt: That Chriſtians would ſit more under Chriſts ſhadow, make uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, <hi>Work</hi> all your works under this ſhadow: Whatever you have to do for God, or for your Souls, or for eternity; whatſoever your hand finds to do, be ſure you do it under this ſhadow: it's hard working in the open Sun in the heat of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it makes mens labours very uncomfortable, it adds to their toyl; but if they work under a ſhadow, it's a ſweet refreſhment to him, and it's a great eaſe to his work, he toiles and ſweats leſs and with leſs pains: ſo Chriſtians if you ſet your ſelves directly under Chriſt when ever you have any work to do for God, or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your ſouls, or when ever you have any burden that is too heavie, ſet your ſelves under Chriſt, through Chriſt you may do all things, and you may bear your burdens with a great deal of more eaſe and comfort; the Soul under Chriſt feels not the weight, nor burden which would ſink another that is not under this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then again, Secondly, as you ſhould work all your works under this ſhadow, ſo be ſure to <hi>Walk</hi> under this ſhadow: I ſay walk under this ſhadow in the whole courſe of your walking with God: Walk in the ſhadow, and it will be a great deal more comfortable unto you: Why, the Lord Jeſus himſelf delights to walk with the Soul when it's under the ſhadow of this ſun. God came and walked in the Garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. in the <hi>cool of the day,</hi> God delights to walk
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42593:35"/> with the Soul when it's under the ſhadow of Chriſt, he delights there to manifeſt himſelf much to the Soul. Oh it's hot walking with God when the poor creature is not under the ſhadow of Chriſt; why, the preſence of God, the very preſence of God will be very hot and uncomfortable, if the Soul be not under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt: Ye can't ſee my face and live: then be ſure you ſet your ſelves under the ſhadow of Chriſt in all your walkings with God: When you pray, pray under this ſhadow, ſet your ſelves under this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and ſo when you hear, read, and meditate, in the whole courſe and way of your walking, be ſure you ſet your ſelves under this ſhadow of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, what ſhadows of Chriſt ſhould you ſit under, walk under and work under?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I Anſwer, Firſt of all, look to the <hi>Humane nature of Chriſt,</hi> that is a ſweet comfortable ſhadow through which you may ſee the face of God; I ſay the human Nature of Chriſt it's a ſhadow, a vail through which you may behold the face of God: God out of Chriſt is a great way off, and you cannot ſee the face of God he is ſo glorious, he is too glorious for your eye, you can't behold him: Ay but God in our nature, look upon God as he hath taken our nature up unto himſelf, and there you may ſee God nigh unto the poor creature; it's very comfortable to look up unto God through Chriſt, upon or through the ſhadow of the fleſh of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, And then Secondly, make uſe of <hi>the ſufferings of Chriſt:</hi> thoſe are ſhadows that Chriſtians ſhould always walk under, and work under, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template under; as I ſaid before, they were terrible ſhadows to Chriſt, they were ſhadows of the night unto Chriſt: Ay but they are comfortable ſhadows; all that Chriſt ſuffered, and every paſſage of his ſufferings,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42593:35"/> even the very ſhadow of Death that went over his head, it's a ſweet and comfortable ſhadow unto his people that ſit under him in it: Now poor ſouls ſitting under theſe ſhadows there is a great deal to be ſeen, and the Soul by faith ſits under theſe ſhadows: and under theſe ſhadows of the ſufferings of Chriſt, Oh the glorious ſight that it may have by faith; here it may ſee Juſtice and mercy meeting, and kiſs each other, here it may ſee Juſtice reconciled and ſin carried out and everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in: here it may ſee reconciliation purchaſed, and a way made for thoſe that were afar off to come nigh unto God: here it may ſee deliverance from that wrath which is to come; it may ſee Death, Hell, ſin and Satan and all trodden under foot; here it may ſee all grace, and all ſtrength purchaſed by Chriſt; here it may ſee a door of grace, and a door of Life ſet open, and Oh what a glorious ſight may the Soul ſee there!</p>
            <p>3. Again, Thirdly, ſit under the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt, take heed you neglect not theſe ſhadows of Chriſt, and look at all the ordinances as ſhadows of Chriſt: this is the way to uſe ordinances aright: men and women never uſe ordinances aright untill ſuch time as they look upon ordinances under this notion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as they are ſhadows of Chriſt, as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt and hold forth ſomething of Chriſt. Take an Ordinance as it's out of Chriſt, and it's a ſhadow indeed, a meer ſhadow, a ſhadow of ſhadows, but take the ſhadow as it's in Chriſt, and then it's a glorious ſhadow, and holds forth abundance of ſweetneſs and grace and comfort and refreſhment; and then be ſure you keep under Chriſt in the ordinance; when the Soul thus looks upon ordinances, as ſhadows of Chriſt, then ordinances are ſweet and refreſhing, and the Soul may ſee cauſe for ever to bleſs the Lord that he hath provided
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42593:36"/> ſhadows for poor Souls to ſit under; that's a Third particular.</p>
            <p>Again, Fourthly, you that have Intereſt in Chriſt know it's not enough to ſit under his ſhadow, but delight your ſelves in ſitting under his ſhadow: be like to the ſpouſe in this; ſhe ſits and ſits with <hi>delight</hi> under this ſhadow of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, what is it to ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt with <hi>delight?</hi> when may a Soul be ſaid to ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt with delight, under the ordinances?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Delight, it's a complacency and reſt which the ſoul takes of a ſuitable good: ſo that then the ſoul may be ſaid to delight in Chriſt, or under the ſhadow of Chriſt, whenas it reſts and takes up in Chriſt, as in the moſt ſuitable good; Oh what is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, and ſo ſuitable to a poor weary traveller as a comfortable refreſhing ſhadow is to ſit under? And Oh ſo, what ſo ſuitable to a poor weary ſoul as the comfortable ſhadow of Chriſt to ſit under? When the ſoul doth thus apprehend this ſuitableneſs of Chriſt to it, Oh here's a ſuitable ſhadow, here's a great ſhadow, it's long and large, it's able to cover multitudes of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; here's a might ſhadow, that can fence off abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wrath and diſpleaſure. My ſin hath reacht up to heaven, but here's a ſhadow that is higher than the Heavens; here's the ſhadow of the day, a refreſhing ſhadow, and how ſuitable is that to a Poor ſoul, that hath ſat long under the ſhadows of the night, the ſhadows of darkneſs, or the ſhadow of death? When the Soul doth thus look upon Chriſt as the moſt ſuitable good, and ſo to take up in him, then may the ſoul be ſaid to ſit down with delight under Chriſts ſhadow. But then again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, What a man delights in, that he is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42593:36"/> continually <hi>taken up withal;</hi> his thoughts they run out much upon it: So the ſoul that delights in Chriſt, ſits under Chriſts ſhadow with delight, it's much in the meditation of Chriſt, continually taken up with Chriſt. What ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 1. His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night:</hi> His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and how is that known? by his continual meditation of it: I know a gracious heart it may be weighed down by the prevalency of corruption, ay but it looks upon it as a burden, it crys out, Oh Lord how long ſhall my ſpirit cleave to the duſt! or with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom. 7. Who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death?</hi> from this carnal heart, and this ſenſual frame of ſpirit? He is never well but when with Chriſt, he is then in his Element, Oh then how doth he rejoyce when he ſees Chriſt lifted up and transfigured on the mount? Oh then it's good to be here always, let me never go down, but let me always live with God: here's a ſoul lifted up with delight in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. Again, Thirdly, what the ſoul delights in, that it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> and <hi>deſires more</hi> of: a ſoul that delights in Chriſt, it deſires more of Chriſt, more communion with Chriſt, more acquaintance with Chriſt, it's never ſatisfied: See what <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſalm 119. 174. I have longed for thy ſalvation O Lord, and thy Law is my delight:</hi> when the Law was his delight, he longed for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; how did his ſoul long for God and after Chriſt? he expreſſes it in <hi>Pſalm 42. 1. As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo doth my ſoul after thee O God:</hi> as the hart panteth and breatheth after the water-brooks, ſo his ſoul <hi>panted after God,</hi> and when ſhall he get nigher God; <hi>When ſhall I come and appear before thee?</hi> The deſires of the Soul prepare the ſoul for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42593:37"/> delight, and ſtretch the ſoul wide for delight, when it ſhall enjoy that which it doth deſire.</p>
            <p>4. Again, Fourthly, delight in the ſoul doth beget ſtrong deſires in the ſoul, that it may enjoy more of God; and the ſoul that is thus carried out after Chriſt, deſires to ſee him more, and to enjoy him more, deſires to do all in Chriſt, to work under his ſhadow, and to delight under his ſhadow, to contemplate under his ſhadow, and walk under his ſhadow, then may the ſoul be ſaid to delight in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Well then poor ſouls, what care ſhould you take to ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt, to ſit and to ſit under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with great delight: with the more delight you ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt, the more do you expreſs the power of grace, and the power of Godlineſs; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it's the excellency of a Chriſtian, and the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of grace, that the ſoul can be taken up with delight in Chriſt: as it is with the ſinfulneſs of ſin, it's the height of wickedneſs and ſin, when the ſinner delights in ſin, when he doth not only act in ſin, but delight in ſin, and in doing evil; even ſo when the Soul doth not think enough to do that which is good, but deſires to do it with delight, and can delight in God and delight in Chriſt, and delight in grace and holineſs, delight in doing for God, and delight in ſuffering for God, the more you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Chriſt, the more ſhall you expreſs the power of grace.</p>
            <p>5. But again, conſider what cauſe you have to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your delight in Chriſt: remember what delight the Lord Jeſus took in ſitting under theſe ſhadows (which were moſt uncomfortable to him) for your ſakes; <hi>lo I come to do thy will, O my God,</hi> in the 40. <hi>Pſalm 8. I delight to do thy will O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart.</hi> It was hard work to Chriſt, and yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in it, becauſe it was his fathers work, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42593:37"/> your ſouls were concerned in it; it was the work of your redemption, and though it was a bitter cup, yet the Lord Jeſus took delight in it: If Chriſt delighted in theſe uncomfortable ſhadows, in the ſhadow of Death for your ſakes, Oh why ſhould not you expreſs the comfort and Joy of your hearts, in taking delight in being under his ſhadow? Again, Chriſt, he is the delight of God the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Father: in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. It's the father that ſpeaks of his ſon, he ſpeaks of Chriſt, <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;</hi> he would have you not only behold him as a ſervant, but as his Elect in whom he delights: now if he be the delight of his father, what cauſe have you then to make him the delight of your Souls?</p>
            <p>Nay further, It's the way to have all the deſires of your hearts to be ſatisfied, to be filled; there's an expreſs place for that, in <hi>Pſa. 37. 4. Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thine heart:</hi> He was ſpeaking before that he ſhould not fret becauſe of the wicked, yea think that they have all that heart can wiſh, but you are miſtaken, their deſires are not ſatisfied, the more they drink, the more they thirſt, they are not ſatisfied in the enjoyment of any creature comfort; but I will ſhew you the way of ſatisfaction, delight in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thine heart; it's the way to more grace and more ſtrength, it's the way to be more able to do for God, and more able to ſuffer for God, and abundance comes in, in this way in delighting in Chriſt: when the Lord hath brought the ſoul into this frame once, to take delight in Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome ſhadows of Chriſt, Chriſt he is not far off from that Soul, but will ſatisfie and reveal himſelf to that Soul in a moſt glorious manner: ſee <hi>Mal. 3. 1. Behold I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42593:38"/> come to his temple, even the meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in;</hi> and he ſhall come ſuddenly, he is not far off; and this is an evidence of this his coming, that he ſtirs you up to ſeek him and to delight in himſelf, to ſit under the ſhadow of Chriſt with delight. Oh then Chriſt he will come, and will come ſuddenly, and to manifeſt himſelf in a more glorious manner to that Soul that doth thus delight in him.</p>
            <p>Well then, to conclude, I beſeech you Brethren that you would look up to the Lord to have this frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wrought in your hearts. Do not think it enough to have theſe ſhadows, but delight your ſouls under theſe ſhadows. Chriſt calls for a great deal of delight from you to himſelf: he is a moſt comfortable ſhadow, a moſt pleaſant ſhadow, he is as the ſhadow of a tree, and as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary Land: and as he is of great benefit to you, ſo he calls for much delight from you; <hi>Behold I bring you tidings of great joy,</hi> ſays the Angel to the ſhepherds; where Chriſt is, there's tidings of great joy: and ſo when Chriſt draws nigh to your ſouls in his ſhadows, he expects there ſhould be great joy and delight in him, that you ſhould ſolace your ſelves under theſe ſhadow of Chriſt, ſit down and meditate under theſe ſhadows: whilſt you look under the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt and ordinances of Chriſt, ſee what a glorious proſpect the Lord hath ſet before your eyes, that you may take great delight: delight in every ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt, delight in his ordinances, ſet your ſelves under theſe ſhadows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It's ſaid thoſe that were ſick and diſeaſed, they laid them in the high way that the ſhadow of <hi>Peter</hi> might go over them; ſhall the ſhadow of <hi>Peter</hi> heal diſeaſed bodies? why it's Chriſt under whoſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow who ever comes will heal diſeaſed Souls, and he is greatly to be delighted in, he is a ſweet refreſhing ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42593:39"/> Chriſt, and it doth taſte the ſweet fruit of Chriſt, and it finds pleaſure in them, in feeding upon Chriſt: even as the palate doth find delight in ſavorie meats and delightful drinks: I ſhewed Chriſt yields both ſhadow and fruit: you ſee the mercies that Chriſt gives to his people, they are compleat mercies, for he is a compleat and a perfect ſaviour: he is not only a ſhadow, he is not only a defence unto them, he doth not only keep off evil, he doth not only keep off the ſcorching beams of the ſun, he doth not only keep off the wrath and diſpleaſure of the Father, but he is a pleaſant ſhadow and yields pleaſant fruit, under whom they may ſit, and eat with delight and pleaſure. So he is a perfect ſaviour: he is not only a privative but a poſitive Salvation; this is that which the Lord holds forth to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am thy buckler, and thy exceeding great reward: I am thy buckler,</hi> there's the ſhadow, and <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward,</hi> there's the fruit which the Lord gives him to feed upon. Chriſt doth not only deliver from wrath, but he brings in Life, glory and ſalvation, in <hi>Dan. 9. 24. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy City, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins; and to make reconciliation for iniquitie, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. he ſhall carry out ſin, and bring in righteouſneſs; to take off ſin that's not enough, but to brings in righteouſneſs, an everlaſting righteouſneſs, far more glorious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the righteouſneſs of men, or Angels; he ſhall deliver his people from the fear of death, this is a mercie: but that's not all, Chriſt, he brings in a glorious <hi>hope,</hi> hope of life, hope of glory; <hi>who hath begotten us again unto a lively hope,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. He doth not think it enough to deliver his people from the Slavery of ſin, but he tranſlates them into
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42593:39"/> the freedom and liberty of the Sons of God, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them from the power of ſin, and he puts them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of grace, he brings them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs, and he brings them into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own glorious light: it was not enough, to free them from wrath, to ſave them from hell, but he will put them into the poſſeſſion of glory, and therefore he prayes his Father in <hi>John</hi> 17. that <hi>he would let them be where he is:</hi> he hath been a ſhadow to them, but that's not enough, they ſhall eat of his fruit, <hi>let them be with me where I am that they may behold the glory thou haſt given me,</hi> which is and which was before the foundations of the world were laid. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, therefore brethren let your expectations and faith be according to the largeneſs of the heart of Chriſt, don't think it enough that you ſit under his ſhadow, that the Lord Chriſt is one that can free you from wrath, don't think that enough; but look further to taſte of his fruit, look up for thoſe joyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of his Spirit, which he is willing to pour into your ſouls, as well as to free your ſouls from the apprehenſion of wrath; and ſo don't think it enough that you are delivered from the ſlavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin, that ſin hath not dominion over you, don't think that enough, but look out further for the life of Chriſt to be revealed in you, to be manifeſted unto you, for life and righteouſneſs to raign glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in your hearts, let your expectations be according to the largeneſs of the heart of Chriſt. And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, you ſhould deal with the Lord Chriſt as he deals with you. He did not think privative ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation enough; it was not enough to make a ſhadow for you, but he prepares fruit for you: and therefore don't think it enough that you have bare negative holineſs, that what you do is not againſt Chriſt, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42593:40"/> that you do what you do for Chriſt; for <hi>he that is not with me</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>is againſt me.</hi> Don't think it enough, that you paſs your time and ſpend your dayes, without being conſcious of any wilful Sinning, but what you do from day to day, deal with Chriſt as he deals with you, that you may lift up his name, and honour him who will in due time honour and lift up you. That's the firſt particular. Again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Chriſt brings you firſt unto the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and then he gives of his fruit to eat, and then he cauſes you to taſte of his fruit. Becauſe ſhe was brought under his ſhadow, therefore ſhe ſhall eat of his fruit: ſee how the Lord doth make one mercy to be the beginning of another mercie unto his people: it's Gods ordinary way of dealing with his Servants, becauſe he hath ſhown them mercy, therefore he will ſhew them mercy, becauſe he hath brought them under his ſhadow, he will have them to eat of his fruit. See <hi>Gen. 18. 17, 18. Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do,</hi> ſays God, <hi>ſeeing Abraham ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him?</hi> in his ſeed, in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah that ſhall come out of his loins; yea and becauſe I have given out this mercy, I won't hide what I will do: God makes one mercy to be the beginning of another. And ſo when he promiſed to bring his people unto the mount a in in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 7. it was a mercy to be brought to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of God, yea but God does not leave his people there, but that mercy ſhall be a ſtep to many a mercy, which he intends to give out: when I have brought them thither, when I have got them thither, then <hi>will I make them joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in my houſe of prayer I will make a feaſt to them, a feaſt of fat things;</hi> I'le chear, hearts their and accept of their ſacrifices and ſervices: and thus God makes one mercy, the beginning of another. And therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42593:40"/> do but ſee what a large teſtimony this gives unto the infinite goodneſs, and riches of free grace, which is in our God; well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he hath loved us,</hi> what riches of mercy is here? what fulneſs of grace and mercy in Chriſt is here? that he ſhould make mercy the way to mercy, and mercy the beginning of mercy. Oh what fulneſs of grace and mercy is there in Chriſt? he is never well but when he is giving out: we ſee the glory, <hi>the glory of the only begotten ſon of God, full of grace and truth;</hi> there's a fulneſs indeed, all infinite fulneſs, and this fulneſs doth delight to empty it ſelf and to communicate it ſelf unto poor empty creatures; the riches of grace is mightily held forth in this. And then what encouragement is here to poor ſouls, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own unworthineſs? They want ſuch and ſuch mercies, and ſuch and ſuch graces and ſtrength, and I have received more mercy, than ever I can be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for, and how can I, or dare I be ſo bold with God, to ask more mercy than I am able to expreſs thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him for what I have received? Why, if thou haſt no argument to plead with God, he will make this an Argument, becauſe he hath done thee good already; this is not the manner of men, but it's the way of God: it's no argument with men; you ſhewed me ſuch and ſuch kindneſs, and therefore do me another ſuch kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but the Lord he doth thus, he will make this an argument, his doing of thee good, from thence he will do thee good again. But then again,</p>
            <p>3. Here is a third particular obſervable, Firſt the ſhadow, and then the fruit. See how the Lord doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed gradually in a way of mercy in doing good to poor creatures; the longer they are with him, and the more they know him, the greater mercy he gives out: it's a greater mercy to eat of the fruit, than to ſit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42593:41"/> under the ſhadow: well, after Chriſt hath cauſed thee to ſit under his ſhadow, then he will give thee to eat of the fruit: the Lord deals with his ſervants as you deal with your ſervants; it may be you are not ſo friendly to them at firſt when they come to be appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, but afterward when they have ſerved you long, and you have learnt them more of the myſtery of their trade, you will uſe them more friendly and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate yet more of the myſtery of your trade, and ſecrets, and the like: and ſo the Lord deals with his ſervants, though he may hide his face for a time, yet at laſt he will ſhine graciouſly upon them, he will deal friendly with them, he will uſe them as friends and not as Servants, he will communicate of his ſecrets to them; I <hi>call you not Servants, but I call you friends,</hi> as Chriſt did to his diſciples at laſt, for he reveals the whole will of his father unto them; and therefore what encouragement is here to all you who are Chriſts? although it may be for the preſent, you have not ſuch comings in from Chriſt, you may ſay, bleſſed be God, I ſit under the ſhadow, and the Lord Chriſt is a ſafety to me: but you have not found of that ſweetneſs which is ſpoken of him; yet let me tell you, you ſhall eat of his dainties, the longer you are his ſervants the more gently will he deal with you, and learn you, and ſhew you great things; the Lord Chriſt will ſhew greater and greater things to his people, the longer they are in his houſe, the longer they ſerve him, the more they ſhall know of his Fathers mind and will, and the more friendly will he deal with them; and therefore don't fear things to come, or conditions to come, and don't think that things to come may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from his love, for certainly the longer you are with him, the better he'l uſe you; and as it may be ſaid of wicked men, the worſt is ſtill to come, ſo of the righteous man, the beſt is ſtill to come, the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42593:41"/> beſt is ſtill behind; ſo long as they are on this ſide the grave, on this ſide of Heaven, the beſt is ſtill behind, for Chriſt reſerves better and better for his people: Theſe are the particular obſervations that do offer themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall make entrance into the main general propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or obſervation which the words hold forth, and that is this.</p>
            <p>Obſer. <hi>That the fruit that grows upon Chriſt it exceeding pleaſant to the believing Soul:</hi> the fruit that grows upon Chriſt is exceeding pleaſant and ſweet; he is a generous Vine of Gods own planting, the choiceſt tree that ever the hand of God planted, and therefore the beſt fruit; the ſweeteſt fruit that ever grew upon tree, it grows upon Chriſt: It was fruit that the great King of Heaven intended for his own ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it muſt needs be ſweet fruit, excellent fruit; God intended that all the fruit that he would feaſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and his friends and children with, ſhould grow upon this tree; and therefore it muſt needs be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruit, he intends to make a feaſt unto his people, a feaſt of fat things, as is promiſed in <hi>Iſa. 25. 6. and in this mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſes make unto all people a feaſt of fat things, a feaſte of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined:</hi> now all the fat things that are at the feaſt with which God doth refreſh the ſouls of his people upon this mountain, grow upon this tree, all the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I ſay it comes from this Olive-tree, and all thoſe cups of ſweet conſolations which the Lord doth ſtay poor fainting and bleeding Souls with, it's the fruit of this tree; nay the great feaſt that God ſhall make in Heaven, at the great ſupper of the Lamb, with which God ſhall feaſt all his people for ever and ever, and ſit and riſe no more, and all the dainties that ſhall be at the ſupper of the Lamb, it ſhall be the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42593:42"/> fruit of this tree, they ſhall ever feed upon Chriſt, and for ever feed upon that fruit which grew upon Chriſt, they ſhall feed for ever upon this one diſh, and ſhall never be weary of this fruit; and therefore certainly the fruit that grows upon Chriſt, it muſt needs be exceeding ſweet and delightful fruit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, what is the fruit that grow upon this tree? What is this fruit that is ſo ſweet and delightful?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, there are innumerable kinds, more than can be reckoned. I ſhall give you a taſte of ſome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, there's the fruit of <hi>Chriſts heart,</hi> the fruit that grows upon Chriſts heart. Oh! the abundance of precious fruit; all thoſe gracious thoughts which are in the heart of Chriſt to his people, are one kind of precious fruit that grows upon this tree: in <hi>Iſa. 10. 12. I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria:</hi> God ſpeaks of the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> but the fruit that grows upon the heart of Chriſt it's other kind of fruit: it's not the fruit of a ſtout heart, but it's the fruit of a gracious heart: <hi>many are thy wonderful works, O Lord,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 40. 5. and thy thoughts which are to us ward;</hi> the gracious thoughts of the heart of Chriſt towards his people, they are many, they are more than can be numbred. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to conſider the fruit that grows upon the heart of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, there's abundance of meekneſs and lowlineſs of mind, and tenderneſs towards poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which grows upon the heart of Chriſt; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. when he calls poor creatures to him, <hi>v. 28, 29, I am meek and lowly in heart;</hi> it's an argument by which Chriſt doth invite poor heavie laden ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42593:42"/> to come to him: why, but they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from coming, by looking upon Chriſt as full of wrath, anger and implacable, ſaying, Chriſt will not be reconciled: you are miſtaken of me, ſays Chriſt, there is no ſuch ſowr fruit grows upon my heart, though this be your diſpoſition, yet it's not mine, <hi>I am meek.</hi> But I am a poor worm, ſaith the ſoul, and will the Lord ever look down on ſuch a poor worm? he is aſcended and ſits in glory, and will he look upon a poor worm? <hi>I am meek and lowly,</hi> ſays Chriſt, though I be never ſo high, I can look upon poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I am meek and lowly in heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, there are in Chriſts heart <hi>very earneſt deſires of reconciliation with poor creatures,</hi> this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other gracious fruit that grows upon Chriſts heart: I ſay vaſt deſires and large deſires, if poor creatures will come in and accept of thoſe tenders of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he is pleaſed to make in his Goſpel, let them come, ſays he, let them come, <hi>he that is a thirſt let him come, and whoſoever will let them come, and let them drink of the water of life freely;</hi> I deſire you ſhould come, ſays Chriſt, let no man hinder, let him not lay blocks in his own way, I am willing he ſhould come: and thus doth Chriſt hold forth his golden Scepter, as <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> did his golden ſcepter to <hi>Heſter,</hi> come in <hi>Heſter,</hi> ſays he; ſo ſays Chriſt, Poor Soul, come, let him come, in and drink of the water of life freely. And ſo, <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, that you would be reconciled unto him.</hi> That's a ſecond fruit that grows on Chriſts heart. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, there are <hi>affections,</hi> that grow upon Chriſts heart, <hi>ſympathizing affections:</hi> Oh! how tender is he of his people, he ſuffers when they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, he bears the leavieſt end of the burden; <hi>in all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42593:43"/> their afflictions he was afflicted:</hi> and therefore he is called a merciful High Prieſt, and he is one that knows how to have compaſſion, and how to be tender, ſee <hi>Heb. 5. 1, 2. for every High Prieſt taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſin, who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, for that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo is compaſſed with infirmity.</hi> He can have compaſſion, he is able to have compaſſion, he hath a compaſſionate diſpoſition within him, he knows how to pity them when ignorant, and when they are out of the way, he knows how to portion out grace to every of his peoples conditions, he knows how to ſympathize with them in their burdens, for he was compaſſed about with our Infirmities, he knows well what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are, and what temptations to ſin are, and he beſt knows how to compaſſionate his people; theſe compaſſions are a gracious fruit growing in Chriſts heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, But then again, there are <hi>thoughts of delight</hi> in Chriſts heart. Oh how doth he rejoyce over his people with joy, with great joy! He doth ſolace himſelf in their communion: <hi>I am the roſe of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and the lily of the valleys, as the lily among thorns, ſo is my love among the daughters;</hi> ſhe is unto him as the lily among thorns, <hi>let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely:</hi> the expreſſions of the great delight, that Chriſt takes in his people, this is the fruit of Chriſts heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is the fruit of <hi>his lips;</hi> not onely the fruit of his heart is exceeding delightful, but the fruit of his lips is exceeding ſweet: ſee <hi>Iſa. 57. 19 I create the fruit of the lips Peace, peace to him that is afar off and to him that is nigh,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42593:43"/> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and I will heal him:</hi> peace it's a fruit of Chriſts lips; as there are thoughts of peace in his heart, ſo there are words of peace in his mouth, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will ſpeak; therefore it's ſaid, that the tongue of the learned is given to him, <hi>the Lord hath given to him the tongue of the learned, and he knows how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon;</hi> there is none in all the world can ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the wounded Soul but Chriſt, his lips are like unto the lilies dropping ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myrrhe: every promiſe in the Goſpel is a fruit of the lips of Chriſt, and Oh! how ſweet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing is this fruit, how delightful is the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt! if he be pleaſed to bring it home to the ſoul, it ſtays it as with flaggons of wine, when Chriſt ſhall bring home a promiſe to the Soul; elſe a promiſe will do us no good, will be of no uſe to us, <hi>for all the promiſes of God, they are in him yea, and in him Amen;</hi> all the promiſes they grow upon this tree, and it's moſt precious fruit: if you will take <hi>Davids</hi> commendation of it, he eat and commended it, <hi>Pſal. 19. 10. more to be deſired are they than gold, yea than much fine gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he ſpeaks of the word of the Lord, the promiſes of the Lord, they are ſweeter than the honey; nay take it when it is at the ſweeteſt, when it is in the Comb, the word of the Lord goes beyond it, <hi>Sweeter than the Honey, and the honey Comb:</hi> Oh! how gracious and acceptable is the leaſt word that drops from Chriſts Mouth, out of Chriſts lips to the poor wounded bleeding Soul? <hi>A word in ſeaſon,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, is like Apples of gold in Pictures of Silver;</hi> pleaſant and exceeding acceptable fruit unto a poor ſoul. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, There's not only the fruit of Chriſts lips, but the fruit of Chriſts <hi>loins.</hi> Oh the fruit
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42593:44"/> of his womb! he hath a ſeed which he brings forth unto God, which are pleaſant and much be to delighted in; all that are brought in to God by the preaching of the Goſpel, they are called the fruit of Chriſt, they are his ſeed, <hi>he ſhall ſee the travail of his Soul and be ſatisfied;</hi> this fruit is mighty delightful to Chriſt, and therefore ſhould be delightful and is delightful to the Saints. Chriſt had a mighty delight in children, he cared not what he ſuffered, what pains, what travails; let the travail of the Soul be never ſo great, ſo he might bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he cared not, nay though he knew he ſhould die in travail, yet he cared not, and though he knew he ſhould die of it, and alſo live again and riſe again, he askt no other reward but only that he might have children, and it was the great promiſe in <hi>Iſaiah 53. 10, 11. He ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the good pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand; he ſhall ſee the travail of his Soul and ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> he ſhall have a multitudinous offspring, becauſe he was ſuch a lover of children. And therefore when the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham, I'le bleſs thee, and thy ſeed ſhall be as the Stars of heaven that could not be numbred:</hi> and therefore you read in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of a <hi>great number which no man can number,</hi> and he brought them all unto the Father and preſented them, <hi>Here am I and the Children thou haſt given me.</hi> They are exceeding delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him; and as Chriſt takes delight in them, ſo</p>
            <p>The ſaints can't but take delight when they ſee ſouls brought in to God and brought forth for heaven, they cannot but rejoyce in it, and take great delight in this fruit of Chriſt: To name no more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth ſort of fruit, and that's the fruit of <hi>Chriſts life.</hi> Take him as he was here upon earth in the dayes of his fleſh, when he was planted in the Orchard of the world, he brought forth exceeding much fruit unto God,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42593:44"/> he was the moſt fruitful tree that ever the Father planted, he brought forth a world of precious deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruit; there was never any part of Chriſts life that was not fruitful, <hi>he went up and down doing good.</hi> He ſought all opportunities to do good: <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me while the day laſts, for the night cometh when I ſhall not work;</hi> he took all opportunities for the doing good to the ſouls of men, and the bodies of men, and glad was he that he had an opportunitie. There is never a part of Chriſts life, if you look into the hiſtory of it, as it lies before us by the Evangeliſts, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fruitful, and all that fruit was exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and deſirable, and affords an abundance of matter of refreſhment: there is matter of much contemplation when you look into the life of Chriſt. And theſe are ſome of the kinds of fruit which grow upon this Apple-tree, upon Chriſt the tree of life; they are the fruit of his heart, the fruit of his lips, the fruit of his womb, the fruit of his loins, the fruit of his life. There are divers other kinds of fruit, but I ſhall ſpeak no more at this time, the Lord help you to feed upon this fruit.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AFter many particular obſervations, we came the laſt day to the main general propoſition that theſe words hold forth, viz. <hi>The fruit that grows upon Chriſt the tree of life is ſweet to the believing ſoul:</hi> it muſt needs be ſo, for it's the fruit that God doth feaſt his friends withal; the feaſts that he makes to his ſervants upon his holy Mountain they are nothing elſe but the fruit that grows upon this tree: Nay in the great ſupper of the Lamb, that everlaſting feaſt that God ſhall make in heaven, wherein his people ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and ſhall riſe no more, they ſhall have no other dainties but the fruit that grows upon this tree. But what's the fruit that grows upon Chriſt, that is ſo pleaſant and ſweet? I told you of the fruit of his heart, the fruit of his lips, the fruit of his loins, the fruit of his life: and I came in the laſt place to ſpeak of the fruit of his Death, and this is a precious bough full
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42593:45"/> of fruit. Well, what is the fruit that grows upon Chriſts Death?</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Satisfaction of his Fathers Juſtice:</hi> That ſatisfaction which is given to Juſtice is a fruit of Chriſts death; He hath paid the debt, he hath cancelled the bond, he hath given to Juſtice what Juſtice could demand, he hath ſatisfied it to the utmoſt farthing, ſo that now Juſtice and mercy are met together, they now do embrace and kiſs each other; Juſtice is ſatisfied and mercy is ſatisfied; Juſtice is glorified and mercy is glorified: the believing ſoul may look Juſtice in the face as well as mercy in the face, becauſe Juſtice hath fully as much from Chriſt, as it can demand; now this ſatisfaction which is given to Juſtice it's a fruit of Chriſts death; But again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, By the death of Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt is made a fit Object for poor ſinners to pitch upon;</hi> He is an Object for the guilty ſinner that durſt not look Chriſt in the face, he is a ſuitable object to a poor bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner; there's abundance of precious fruit that grows upon Chriſt the tree of life, but this tree it was too high for a poor wretch, and could not have been enjoyed if Chriſt had not been willing to have his fruit cut down, he was cut down to the earth, laid upon the earth, humbled to the death of the croſs; ſo that now the poor guilty ſinner that is humbled through the ſenſe of his ſin, may look upon Chriſt in and through his death, and is become a ſuitable object for the poor ſoul to pitch upon: what more ſuitable to a wounded bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcience than a wounded bleeding dying ſaviour? Now that Chriſt is ſo ſuitable an Object for a poor guilty ſinner to pitch upon, this is a fruit of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>3. Again, Thirdly, Chriſt by his death hath <hi>carried out ſin, and brought in righteouſneſs;</hi> this is another fruit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42593:46"/> that grows upon the death of Chriſt, the volume of ſin in reſpect of the guilt, in reſpect of the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of it, he hath carried out, and made an end of it, in <hi>Dan. 9. 24. Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſion and prophecie, and to anoint the moſt holy.</hi> Sin, like a monſter, ſeiſed upon it, ſuckt the very heart blood of Chriſt; well, the Lord Jeſus he will be avenged of him, and therefore his blood, it was the bane of ſin. I'remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural Hiſtory, reports of the enmitie that is betwixt the Dragon and Elephant, the Dragon gets under the Elephant, and ſucks his blood, and by his fall oft-times is the death of the Dragon; and this may be fitly compared to Chriſt, ſin is the Dragon that ſeized upon Chriſt; and the Lord Jeſus by his death fell upon ſin, he hath cruſht it all to pieces, he hath taken away the killing power of ſin, ſo that ſin, by this deed, he hath carried it out, as an abominable thing, and in the room of it he hath brought in a glorious righteouſneſs, a perfect righteouſneſs, and put it upon his people, a far more glorious righteouſneſs than the righteouſneſs of the Angels; ſo that the believing Soul may ſtand in the preſence of God, with much more boldneſs than formerly. This is a third fruit that is brought in by the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. Again, Fourthly, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is brought in as another fruit by the death of Chriſt: perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and ſweet communion and fellowſhip with God, all this is the fruit of Chriſts death; he by his death hath taken in the wall of partitions, and by his death hath made thoſe that were enemies friends; thoſe that were a far off, nigh unto him; ſo that the heart of God
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42593:46"/> is now nigh unto a believing Soul, and the believing ſoul may ſay now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Apoſtle, <hi>truly our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the father, and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Before, it might be ſaid of every man in the world, his fellowſhip was with ſin, with hell, and the devil, and enemies to God; but now by the death of Jeſus Chriſt peace is made, and reconciliation is made, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls may ſay truly, <hi>our fellowſhip is with the father and with the ſon Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> that's a fourth fruit that grows upon the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, The death of Chriſt, <hi>it hath cruſht the head of the old ſerpent,</hi> he hath bound the ſtrong man and caſt him out, and delivered poor captive ſouls out of the mouth and paw of the Lyon; it was promiſed long before Chriſt came, thouſands of years, that <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the ſerpents head:</hi> and Chriſt by his death made good that promiſe, he did cruſh the ſerpents head: by death he overcame him that had the power of death. But then,</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, Here is another fruit of Chriſts death, and that is by <hi>ſubduing the power of ſin and corruption in the hearts of Gods people.</hi> This is a very ſweet and deſirable fruit that grows upon this bough, the death of Chriſt; I ſay the ſubduing and conquering of the power of ſin in the heart: ſee what the Apoſtle ſays of it in <hi>Rom. 6. 11. Likewiſe, ye alſo reckon your ſelves dead unto ſin, but alive unto God:</hi> he ſaid before in v. 10. <hi>In that he died, he died unto ſin once, but in that he liveth he liveth unto God, ſo likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves dead unto ſin;</hi> that is, in that he died he died to ſin to the crucifying of ſin, to the violating and mortifying of the power and ſtrength of ſin; and therefore brethren, account and reckon your ſelves dead unto ſin: fetch arguments from the death of Chriſt to kill ſin; and truly brethren there are no ſuch
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42593:47"/> Powerful arguments in the world to the ſubduing of the Power of ſin, as thoſe which are to be fetcht from the Power of the death of Chriſt. Oh, ſays the believing ſoul, ſhall that be ſweet to me which was ſo bitter to Chriſt? ſhall I look upon that as a friend, which was an enemie to Chriſt? Shall I love that which was a nail and a ſpear to pierce Chriſt? Shall I take delight in that cup, to drink of that cup which was ſuch poyſon to Chriſt? No, God forbid, ſays the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, did not I die with Chriſt? did not he ſtand as a common perſon, and therefore ought not I to have reckoned my ſelf dead, dead unto ſin, even as Chriſt died for ſin? And how then ſhall we that are dead unto ſin, live any longer unto it? This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fruit that grows upon the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, <hi>there is a holy and ſanctified uſe that believers have of all ordinances and of all creatures;</hi> and this comes in as another fruit of the death of Chriſt; to unbelievers (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>all is defiled,</hi> and all is polluted; his conſcience is defiled, he defiles the beſt things, and the holieſt ordinances, he hath no ſanctified uſe of creature comforts: but by the death of Chriſt all ordinances are ſanctified and bleſſed, and all creatures are bleſſed and ſanctified to ſuch as have faith in Chriſt; the blood of Chriſt ſprinkled upon a man hath a ſmell exceeding ſweet, and makes the ſoul to be thankful for every crum; Oh, this morſel is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Chriſts blood; and thus every mercy being ſanctified is ſweetned by the death of Chriſt: and that is moſt comfortable.</p>
            <p>8. Eighthly, Chriſt hath <hi>changed temporal death, and taken away the evil of it for his people;</hi> this is a moſt ſweet and deſirable fruit of the death of Chriſt; that temporal death is changed, ſweetned, ſanctified, that the ſting of death is taken out for all his people:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42593:47"/> Chriſt hath ſent a challenge to death, Oh death, <hi>I will be thy death,</hi> long before he came into the world, and he made good his word when he came, he fought a duel and overcame death, as in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55. O Death where is thy Sting? O grave where is thy victorie?</hi> this is a moſt precious fruit. Nay <hi>death</hi> that was a curſe, is <hi>turned into a bleſſing;</hi> and this makes it a greater mercy, death that was a curſe and the worſt of curſes is turned into a bleſſing to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, it doth them a very good turn, it's the fathers Servant, and it helps to bring them home, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be terrible to look upon its hard vizage, yet ſtill he doth a good office for all that are in Chriſt, he helps to carry them home unto their fathers houſe, and this is another fruit of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>9. Again, Ninthly, Chriſt <hi>hath ſwallowed up eternal death,</hi> he hath vanquiſhed hell, by letting forth the ſtream of his blood, ſo that that now there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt, there's no hell, there's no wrath, no diſpleaſure in the Almighty: he hath opened a door wide to life, grace, and ſalvation; and this is another fruit of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>10. Again, in the Tenth place, Another fruit of Chriſts death is this, <hi>The confirmation and ratification of all the promiſes of the whole Covenant that he hath made with his people:</hi> and this is a moſt precious and deſirable fruit; I ſay by the Death of Chriſt all the promiſes are confirmed and ratified: he hath confirmed his teſtament, his laſt will and teſtament, with all the Legacies that Chriſt gave to his people, he bequeathed grace, life and ſalvation, and all theſe were ratified, when Chriſt died. When a man dies, his will is ſure, then there's no man can alter the will of him that is dead, for by death the will is ratified: As the Covenant is unalterable being ratified by the death of Chriſt, ſo every
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42593:48"/> promiſe is ratified by the death of Chriſt: it's as ſure, that heaven and earth ſhall paſs, but not one jot or tittle of the word ſhall fall to the ground, they ſhall as certainly be fulfilled as God is in heaven; now that the promiſes are ſo ſure, this eſtabliſhment and confirmation it's a bleſſed fruit of the Death of Chriſt. So much for the fruit of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>6. Sixthly, Again in the ſixth place, let us conſider <hi>the fruit of Chriſts reſurrection;</hi> and that hath a great deal of fruit; the reſurrection of Chriſt, what fruit grows upon this bough! Three ſorts of fruit grow upon this bough. But briefly of theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, the believing ſoul is <hi>fully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly juſtified:</hi> The full and compleat juſtfying of the Soul depends upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt: For when Chriſt aroſe from the dead, he is ſaid to be <hi>juſtified of the Spirit:</hi> That is, he was fully acquitted, he was fully abſolved; God the father declared to all the world that he was ſatisfied, the debt was paid, he was fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: I ſay, it was declared to men and Angels at that time when Chriſt did ariſe, the judge himſelf acquitted him, he did not break priſon, but the father himſelf juſtified him; and it's ſaid, the Angel came and rolled away the ſtone, which makes it evident to all the world that he was juſtified; and ſo he being juſtified, all his people are juſtified virtually in him, ſo that he left all his chains behind him: He did not come forth, when he came forth, bound hand and foot, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, but the Napkins and all bonds were left behind; ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat juſtification of a Sinner comes in by virtue of Chriſts compleat Reſurrection. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Anſwer of a good conſcience by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> A good conſcience may now anſwer, if juſtice come to demand any thing, the good conſcience it may anſwer and ſay, Lord didſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42593:48"/> thou acquit thy ſon by his Reſurrection? didſt not thou roll away the ſtone, or cauſe the Angel to do it? and why doſt thou come to me? That's a ſweet fruit that grows upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the <hi>Quickening of the new man, and the raiſing of a dead heart to life,</hi> is another fruit that grows upon the reſurrection of Chriſt; now Chriſt is he that quickens whom he will: by the mighty power of his reſurrection is a poor ſoul raiſed up to live unto God; I ſay all the life and ſtrength of grace comes from the reſurrection of Chriſt; ſee what the Apoſtle ſays in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. mark, <hi>that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father,</hi> that is, by the glorious power of the father, by that almighty power in which he was ſo glorious, I ſay Chriſt was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dead, <hi>even ſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we ſhould walk in newneſs of life;</hi> it's a mighty argument unto a gracious heart to walk with God, and to live unto God, and to walk in the newneſs of the Spirit; why, Chriſt he is riſen, he is riſen from the dead, and therefore when this word comes to the ſoul that is grovelling here below, and ſeeks Chriſt in dead works and duties, he is not there, he ſees not the death nor the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, but the power of Chriſt doth raiſe ſouls to live unto this newneſs of life, and that is the fruit of the reſurrection of Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, there is another fruit of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, and that is <hi>the Reſurrection of the body at the laſt day,</hi> this is a moſt ſweet fruit that grows upon Chriſt, the reſurrection of the bodies of all his Saints at the laſt day: he is ſaid to be the firſt-<hi>fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept; the firſt-fruits ſanctifie the whole crop, they were to bring the firſt-fruits, the firſt-fruits they were brought forth, the firſt-fruits
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42593:49"/> ſanctifie the crop, that as they ſhould reap that for the glory of God, ſo their whole harveſt: now Chriſt he is the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept, his reſurrection it gives aſſurance unto the ſaints that as he is riſen from the dead, ſo the Lord he ſhall alſo raiſe them up, he ſhall raiſe them up by the mighty power of his reſurrection: ſee there in the Goſpel by Matthew 27. 52. <hi>And many bodies of the ſaints which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many;</hi> a pledge given of our reſurrection, that all the ſaints ſhall be raiſed at the laſt, many of the Saints that ſlept in the duſt they aroſe, and were ſeen of many in <hi>Jerſalem,</hi> there were witneſſes of it; this is a pledge I ſay that the bodies of all the Saints ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt day; and theſe are the fruits that grow upon Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, There are alſo many fruits that grow upon Chriſts <hi>Aſcenſion, his Aſcenſion</hi> unto Heaven; to tell you what fruits are there.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, this is the fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion, viz. <hi>The glorious triumph over all enemies, and powers of darkneſs,</hi> both in his own perſon, and in his people, I ſay a glorious triumph over all enemies, for the day of Chriſts Aſcenſion was the day of his triumph; it's ſaid in <hi>Epheſ. 4. 8. when he aſcended on high he led captivity captive;</hi> alluding to a great conqueſt that when they have taken captives they will have a day of triumph to ſhew them openly: and ſo Jeſus Chriſt he led captivity captive, Sin and Satan and all the powers of darkneſs that had led poor ſouls captive, even them hath he led captive, and looks upon all theſe as bound by Chriſt, and they ſhall do no great harm: that's the firſt fruit of Chriſts aſcenſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the <hi>donation of the ſpirit, and all the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42593:49"/> gifts of the Spirit,</hi> is another fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it's ſaid before in that place of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That when he aſcended on high, he led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and <hi>he gave gifts to men:</hi> all the gifts that are given to Churches, to men for the uſe of the Churches, they are the fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion: Nay, all the gifts and graces that are given to any particular Soul, they are fruits of Chriſts Aſcenſion; he gave gifts to men, yea, to the <hi>Rebellious:</hi> yea, <hi>The Spirit of grace and conſolation</hi> is given to the Saints to comfort them, and to lead them into truth. See what Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in <hi>John 16. 7. Nevertheleſs I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you:</hi> ſee how the ſending of the Spirit did depend upon Chriſts going, If I do not aſcend, the Spirit will not come; but if I go, I will ſend him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But again Thirdly, There is another fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion, and that is, <hi>The carrying up of the hearts of his people into Heaven:</hi> the holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and thoſe heavenly affections and diſpoſitions, which are (or ſhould be) in all the Saints, they are the fruits of Chriſts Aſcenſion, for he aſcended for this very end that he might lift up their hearts: <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all men after me:</hi> he was lifted up into heaven, that he might draw eyes and ſouls after him: and therefore it's obſervable how Chriſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he aſcended openly, he aſcended in the view of all that were preſent: he aſcended whileſt he was in the midſt of his Diſciples, talking of things concerning the Churches, he preſently aſcended; this was one end why Chriſt would not aſcend in ſecret, but openly, that they may know he is in Heaven, and that by the ſight of his Aſcenſion he might draw them after him in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42593:50"/> Spirit, though they could not follow him in body for the preſent: as the Eagle, when ſhe teaches her young ones, ſhe goes before and flyeth aloft, that they may follow after her; and thus doth the Lord Jeſus, he ſoars aloft, that he might make his Saints to give holy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, at leaſt in their Spirits, whilſt their bodies are here on earth; Oh, he can't endure that they ſhould be creeping here below; a low ſpirit and a low conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is not fit for Saints: he would not have his people to have rooting in the earth, he would have his people be like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod: <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod it was not like other Trees, it had no rooting in the earth, and yet it bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed; ſuch would the Lord have his people to be, he can't away that they ſhould have low converſations, that their affections ſhould be creeping here upon the earth and not ſoaring aloft, and living in heaven where he is. Under the Levitical Law, the things that did creep upon the earth, they were abominable, and they were unclean; God gave a Commandment in <hi>Levit. 11. 41. And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ſhall be an abomination, it ſhall not be eaten;</hi> it doth typifie what the Lord would have his people to be, he would not have his people to live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on the earth: the earth is but duſt, and that's Serpents meat; the Lord would have them to live above as Chriſt did, that his Aſcenſion might be a means to draw their hearts above, that their affections, meditations and deſires, and whole converſation might be in heaven: as for us, ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in heaven;</hi> now when this converſation is given out to any of the Saints, let them be thankful to Chriſt for it, it's not in themſelves, it's the fruit of this bough that proceeds from Chriſt the Tree of Life. But then</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42593:50"/>4. Fourthly, Again, all thoſe boughs and branches that are above, they with all the <hi>Manſions</hi> are the fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion, in <hi>John 14. 2. In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told you; I go to prepare a place for you;</hi> this is one end of Chriſts going to heaven that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for all his people, that he might furniſh a Table with great glory, that he might prepare a great ſupper againſt their coming, that he might beſpeak a great welcom for them againſt they come there; I ſay there are glorious preparations that Chriſt is making to entertain his people with, when they are come into heaven, ſuch as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor the heart of man can't conceive: all theſe are fruits of Chriſt's Aſcenſion. Beſides, their Aſcenſion in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul at the laſt day, is a fruit or conſequent of Chriſt's Aſcenſion, he aſcended that they might aſcend after him, <hi>Father I will that they which thou haſt given me, may be with me, that they which thou haſt given me, may come and behold my glory:</hi> The Lord Jeſus he hath ſet the doors wide open to his people, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unlocked them, and taken the Keys; he hath not only the Keys of heaven, but of hell; and the Lord he hath ſet a flaming Sword by the way of Paradiſe, that after <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned he ſhould not come there: but Chriſt by his Aſcenſion, he hath taken away that Sword and opened the door, and ſet forth that glory, that they ſhall all be put into the poſſeſſion of that glory which he hath prepared for them; and this Aſcenſion which they ſhall partake of at the laſt day, is a bleſſed conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Chriſts Aſcenſion into heaven. I thought to have ſpoken of the fruit of Chriſt's Mediation or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſo have come to the Uſe, but I ſhall reſerve it for another time.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shewed you what this fruit is, that is ſweet: there are ſeveral kinds of fruit that grow upon Chriſt: you have heard of the fruit of his heart, the fruit of his lips, the fruit of his loins, the fruit of his life: I ſpeak the laſt day of the fruit of his death: and I ſhewed you ten ſeveral fruits that grow upon this bough: I ſpeak alſo of the fruit of his Reſurrection, and the fruit of his Aſcenſion; I ſhall repeat nothing, becauſe I muſt be ſhort. Here's but one bough more, and that is his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> or his <hi>ſitting at the right hand of his Father.</hi> Now, what's the fruit that grows upon this bough, the fruit of Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, <hi>The actual Application of all that he hath purchaſed unto his people;</hi> this is the fruit of Chriſt's Interceſſion, he hath purchaſed by his death, and applies by his Interceſſion: the Lord Jeſus he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for them in particular, he hath all their names in particular upon his breaſt, and he doth not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42593:51"/> for them in the lump, but for every particular ſoul that his Father hath given him: ſo he tells <hi>Simon Peter, I have prayed for thee Simon, that thy faith fail not;</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed pardon of ſin by his blood, but the Application of pardon to this and that ſoul, it's the fruit of Chriſts Interceſſion; and ſo he hath purchaſed grace, and he hath purchaſed glory by his blood; but the giving out of grace, and putting the ſoul into actual poſſeſſion of glory, this is a fruit of Chriſt's Interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again Secondly, There is another precious fruit grows upon this bough, and that is, <hi>The large way, or door that is made and ſet open for poor ſinners to come to God the Father by.</hi> There is a large door for poor ſinners to come to God by, and that this door is open, and held open, we are beholden to Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; in <hi>Heb. 7. 25. He lives for ever to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for all that come to God by him,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaies the Text, <hi>He is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that come to God by him:</hi> ſo that now the poor ſinner that durſt not come to God, that ſtood afar off trembling, that look'd up like the poor Prodigal, and ſaid, <hi>Father I have ſinned before thee in thy ſight, and am not worthy to come under thy roof:</hi> even for ſuch poor ſouls hath Chriſt ſet open a door by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to come to God.</p>
            <p>Will ever Chriſt plead for ſuch a one as I am? Yes, ſaies the Text, <hi>He lives to do it;</hi> he lives for ever for that end, to make Interceſſion for them that come to God by him.</p>
            <p>But is it poſſible that ever Chriſt ſhould prevail for ſuch a one? though Chriſt be willing to intercede, is it poſſible that he ſhould prevail for ſuch a ſinner?</p>
            <p>Yea, it's poſſible with Chriſt, for <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt:</hi> if he could not prevail, he were not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42593:52"/> able to ſave to the uttermoſt, but, ſaies the Text, <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, There is another precious fruit that grows upon the Interceſſion, and that is, <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the perſons, and of the Sacrifices of all his people in his own name and righteouſneſs unto God his Father;</hi> this is the fruit of Chriſt's Interceſſion: He takes all his Children by the hand and leads them to his Father, <hi>Lo,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>here am I, and the Children thou haſt given me.</hi> Father, theſe are my friends, theſe are my beloveds, let them find welcom in heaven for my ſake; he preſents alſo their ſacrifices, all their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, their prayers, their praiſes, and their works, and waſhes them in his blood; it is ſaid in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there was an Angel ſtood by the Altar with a Cenſer in his hand, and he offered much ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, which he mixed with the prayers of the Saints: the Lord Jeſus is that Angel, he mixes all their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices with his Incenſe, that their prayers and praiſes may aſcend before the Lord as Incenſe, that all their liftings up of hands and hearts may be acceptable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, Fourthly, There's another fruit upon the bough of Chriſt's Interceſſion, and that is, <hi>The caſting out of all thoſe Indictments which are brought into the Court by malicious Adverſaries againſt any of his people:</hi> the Lord Jeſus ſits at the right hand of the Father to caſt them out; the Devil brings many a black bill of Indictment, but the Lord Jeſus ſits there to rebuke him; in <hi>Zach. 3. 2. The Lord rebuke thee Satan,</hi> ſaies the Angel, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee:</hi> he pleads for them, he is their Advocate, he lets his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know that all the accuſations that Satan brings in are out of malice and envy: he is a malicious wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wretch, a Murderer from the beginning, he hath

            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, <hi>The preſervation of the Saints in a ſtate of grace,</hi> is a fruit of Chriſt's Interceſſion, they can't fall, it's not poſſible they ſhould be pluck'd out of his hand, for he holds them ſure, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Interceding for them, it's not poſſible they ſhould be forgotten in heaven, for he alwaies bears their names, and preſents them unto his Father; he Intercedes continually for more grace, for new grace and for new ſtrength, and new ſupplies to be given out every moment for his people, and therefore it's not poſſible their faith ſhould fail: <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not;</hi> it's not poſſible that their faith ſhould fail; and this is a fruit of Chriſt's Interceſſion.

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt of all, If the fruit that grows upon Chriſt be ſo ſweet to a believing ſoul, Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uſe of Conviction, Firſt, This may ſerve for Conviction unto ſuch as taſte no ſweetneſs in Chriſt's fruit, that have no longings, no deſires to eat of the fruit of this Tree; why certainly it's an evidence againſt ſuch, they never were yet eſpouſed to Chriſt. It's ſaid of young women in their breeding condition, their deſires are after fruit, rather to feed on fruit than other meat: I am ſure it is ſo with ſuch as are the Spouſes of Chriſt, their deſires are alwaies after fruit, they would by their good will eat nothing elſe, their ſouls are alwaies longing after it, they can't make a good meal, though they have never ſo much of creature comforts, if they have not a diſh of this fruit, of this fruit that grows upon this Tree of Life: Oh poor creatures (they know not, ſuch as find no ſweetneſs) ſurely they know not what this fruit is, <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi> ſaies Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in <hi>John 4. 10. and who it is that ſaith unto thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water;</hi> poor ſoul, thou knoweſt not what this Tree of Life is: Oh my friends, if you knew this Tree, the ſweetneſs of it, you would ſay, Lord give us ever to eat of the fruit of this Tree; what pity is it that ſuch fruit ſhould be loſt, becauſe poor ſouls know not the goodneſs and ſweetneſs of it! It's very ſtrange that poor ſinners ſhould take ſo much delight in the world, ſo much
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42593:53"/> delight in the fruit that grows upon their own ſtock, ſo much pleaſure in the fruit of iniquity, and ſhould find no ſweetneſs, nor ſavour in the fruit that grows upon Chriſt: I ſay there is no fruit ſo ſweet as this, yea there is nothing ſweet but what grows upon this Tree, no mercy ſweet if it grows not on this Tree, if it comes not from this Tree of Life; and yet to a carnal heart every thing but Chriſt is ſweet: Oh ſuch men and women they have loſt their taſte: when a mans appetite is gone, that's a ſign of a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper: give him wholſom meats, and pleaſant drinks, and he tells you they are bitter and unſavoury, it's a ſign of a great diſtemper of the body, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it's a great fore-runner of death: and truly it's thus with mens ſouls that taſte not of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, they have loſt their appetite, why? it's wonderful ſtrange they ſhould find no ſweetneſs in Chriſt: What! ſweetneſs in your profits and pleaſures, ſweetneſs in your luſts and harlotry, and what, no ſweetneſs in Chriſt? Poor creatures, they have loſt their taſte, and the Lord grant it be not a fore-runner of eternal death; you have a wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch men in <hi>Iſa. 5. 20. Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, and put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter:</hi> Wo to them that call the Tree of Life bitter fruit, unſavoury fruit, whoſe ſouls find no ſweetneſs in the feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and in the mean time find ſweetneſs and delight in thoſe things which are indeed bitter, for the fruit of ſin is bitter fruit: Oh that ſuch men would conſider theſe two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, What will you do when your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable fruit is taken from you? There was a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Rev. 18. 14. And the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42593:54"/> fruits that thy ſoul luſted after, are departed from thee, and all things which were goodly and dainty are departed from thee, and thou ſhalt find them no more at all:</hi> The time will come when this will be ſpoken to Contemners of Chriſt, the deſpiſers of that fruit which grows upon this Tree of Life: all thy deſirable fruit is departed from thee, that which thou tookeſt moſt delight in it's departed from thee; the Lord he can eaſily blaſt your fruit, and cauſe it to wither: if the Spirit of the Lord do but blow upon your comforts they are gone, they are gone in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they wither and they fall off immediately, and what will ſuch men do when their fruit is departed from them, if they have not better fruit to live upon?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, Oh that ſuch men would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that fearful threatening againſt deſpiſers of the fruit of the Tree of Life, in <hi>Prov. 1. 31. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices:</hi> They ſhall eat the fruit of their own doings, when they will not liſten to Wiſdoms call; oh my friends it will be very ſowr fruit for a man to eat the fruit of his own waies: the fruit that grows in the High-way ſide it's but ſowr fruit, take heed that you deſpiſe not the Tree of Life, leſt the Lord ſay you ſhall not eat thereof. That's the firſt Uſe of Conviction.</p>
            <p>2. Again, Secondly, Here is a word of Invitation, and I ſhall propound it in the words of the Pſalmiſt, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 8. a gracious Invitation, <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good, bleſſed is the man that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him:</hi> You have heard of the fruit that grows upon Chriſt, and now oh my friends come taſte, and ſee how good the Lord is; the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks as a man that had found a good morſel, found ſome dainty
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42593:54"/> food, he was eating of it alone, he found a great deal of ſweetneſs in it, and he calls his friends, Oh friends come and taſte, and ſee how good it is; if you did but taſte of this meat, you would ſay, Oh taſte and ſee how good the Lord is, there is pleaſure and ſweetneſs, there's enough to take up all your affections, and all your ſenſes, here you may ſee and taſte, you may ſee beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and taſte ſweetneſs: the Tree of Life is not only beautiful, good to look upon, beautiful to the eye, but it's good for food; let me tell you, it's not enough to ſee the beauty of the Tree of Life, it's not enough to look upon it, it's not enough to ſee, but your ſouls muſt taſte, you will never be the better for the fruit that grows upon Chriſt unleſs you taſte it, unleſs you come and feed experimentally upon Chriſt: it's not enough to hear that the Lord is good, it's not enough that you have heard that there is ſo much pleaſant fruit grows upon Chriſt, but as ever you deſire to be nouriſhed, comforted, revived, ſtrengthened and quickened, why then come here and taſte and ſee how good the Lord is: it's mercy that you have an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was a direful threatening in <hi>Luk. 14. 24. For I ſay unto you, that none of theſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper:</hi> That they which were bidden as Gueſts ſhould never taſte of my fruit; the Lord doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſpeak this to you this day, he doth not ſay, You ſhall never taſte of his fruit, but he gives you an Invitation, Oh then come and taſte and ſee the goodneſs of God. Let me tell you by way of motive, That there is nothing in the world will do away the curſed and bitter taſte of ſin, but only the taſte of the fruit of this Tree. Poor ſinners you know not what the taſte of the fruit of ſin is: oh what bitterneſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times doth ſin leave behind! It's ſweet in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whilſt men are committing ſin, whilſt men
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42593:55"/> are in the midſt of their luſts, in the midſt of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, in the midſt of their cups, ſin is ſweet, but oh the bitterneſs, the poyſon of Aſps that ſin leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Conſcience; you have tried it may be to put out the taſte of ſin, to do away the bitterneſs that ſin hath left behind, and you ſwallow many a good Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance after it, many a good duty, as you have ſuppoſed, you have waſhed with your own tears, and yet the taſte of ſin is left behind: and truly Brethren no wonder; there is nothing in the world will do away the taſte, the bitter taſte of ſin, but only the taſte of the fruit of Chriſt: O come and taſte of this fruit, it will leave a ſweet reliſh behind, it will leave a taſte in your ſouls and conſciences, that ſhall alwaies be above and prevail againſt the bitter taſte of ſin.</p>
            <p>Nay further, let me tell you, there is nothing elſe can ſweeten your affliction, there is nothing elſe can ſweeten your temptations, and your trials, but only a taſte of the fruit of Chriſt, this will take away all the bitterneſs: and therefore I beſeech you make good proviſion for your ſelves againſt you take thoſe bitter Pills; you will have ſomething that is ſweet by you, to ſweeten your mouths againſt you take bitter Pills: Oh that men would make ſuch proviſion in and againſt evil daies; death is bitter in it ſelf, and life is ſweet: Oh that the Lord would revive you in giving to you a taſte of the Tree of Life, and this will ſweeten all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and it will take away the bitterneſs of the taſte of death: the Martyrs they felt not the heat of the flames, for they had the juice of the Tree of Life in their mouths and ſouls, and the fruit of the Tree of Life preſerved them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may you know that you have taſted of this fruit of the Tree of Life?</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42593:55"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may know it by your deſires after Chriſt: when the ſoul hath taſted of the fruit of Chriſt, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to taſte more of that fruit, and it will ſee an averſeneſs to ſin: ſo did the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſhe ſat down and deſired to eat (as I told you it was rendred) ſhe ſat down and deſired to eat, and ſtill to eat, her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were carried out ſtill after further and further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and taſts of Chriſt; when the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> had taſted of the ſweetneſs of the water of Life, in <hi>John 14. 15. Give me to drink of this water that I thirſt not:</hi> Give me evermore to drink of this water, ſhe taſted but a drop and this gave her to cry out, O Lord give me evermore to drink of this water: ſo the ſoul having once taſted but a taſte of this fruit of the Tree of Life, Lord give me evermore to eat of this Tree, of this fruit.</p>
            <p>Again, It's known by the contentment, delight and ſatisfaction, that the ſoul doth find in Chriſt, by the taſting of him it hath ſatisfaction in Chriſt, a high eſteem, and honourable eſteem, ſuch an eſteem as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had: he deſired to be a door-keeper in the Courts and Houſe of the Lord: And ſo the ſoul that hath taſted of Chriſt, Oh Lord let me eat of thy fruit, though my condition be never ſo low, let me ſit under thy Tree, though I ſit like <hi>Job</hi> on the Dunghil, let me ſit down and eat of thy fruit, and it's enough, it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies; when it hath Chriſt, whatever it hath it's ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: if it be but the fruit of Chriſt's love, it's ſatisfied: if it be but a piece of bread, if it hath the love of Chriſt with it, I ſhall ſay, Lord my lot is fallen on a goodly ground: and thus ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Noman that hath drank old Wine and taſtes of new, deſires the old again,</hi> becauſe it's bitter to him: ſo no man that is once in Chriſt deſires to taſte of the fruit of ſin, becauſe this fruit is better; Oh that many might be convinced of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42593:56"/> ſin, ſuch as wallow in their luſts, and take more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their luſts than in Chriſt, that have not yet taſted of the fruit of this Tree of Life, the Invitation is even to them, unto ſuch that they might come in and taſte, and ſee how good the Lord is. So much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Secondly, A word of Exhortation to thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt. O that you would come and ſit under this Tree and eat: That Chriſtians would ſit more under Chriſt, and eat more of his fruit. It's not enough to give a pluck and away, a ſnatch and away: but the Spouſe ſhe ſat and pluckt and eat. Chriſt doth not love a haſting geſture, he doth not love ſouls haſt in plucking of his fruit: he doth not love they ſhould poſt over Communion with him, but that they ſhould ſit down and eat. Oh chew well upon the Tree of Life, that you may find that ſweetneſs, that infinite ſweetneſs that is in it: Oh that you would pluck much of the fruit of this Tree; you that have intereſt in Chriſt, pluck much of this fruit, and eat much of this fruit; let me tell you, there is more fruit grows upon one bough than you can pluck all your daies, and make no ſpare; there is more fruit grows upon one bough than you can pluck throughout all Eternity; Oh that you would every day be plucking a little; continually plucking and eating ſome of the fruit that grows upon this Tree of Life, it's but a taſte that you can have, and therefore you had need be often, and alwaies taſting of that fruit which is in him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you can have but a taſte of this ſweetneſs, yet this taſte is exceeding comfortable, reviving and ſtrengthening; I ſay that very taſte it's exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and reviving, there is no fruit ſo full of ſpirit as this fruit that grows upon the Lord Jeſus; and it's full of ſtrength, it will ſtrengthen your ſouls abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42593:56"/> you may know it's very nouriſhing by the ſweetneſs of it: Phyſicians ſay, That which taſtes well, it nouriſhes well, and if ſo, I am ſure this fruit is nouriſhing fruit, for it hath the ſweeteſt taſte, it hath the moſt delightful taſte. O the ſudden ſtrength that the taſte of this fruit hath conveyed unto poor weak and weary ſouls, to ſuch as have been ſpent almoſt in their combates, and ready to faint and give up the Ghoſt, their ſpirits have been ready to fail within them, and the Lord hath given but one taſte of this fruit, ſome fruit or other, the fruit of his death, or the fruit of his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion or Mediation, and it hath given new ſtrength, and new Life to the poor ſoul, and it hath made it ſtand up and leap for joy: it crept upon the earth before, and now it mounts up like the Eagle. Oh this excellent fruit that is in Chriſt, it's worth the plucking, and it's worth the eating.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you may well pluck much of this fruit (you that have intereſt in Chriſt) you have all the advantage that can be; you have the ſhadow over you whilſt you pluck it, and whilſt you eat it, you need not labour much, and toil much, for the Lord (with this Tree) will be a ſhadow to you, you may pluck with delight, and eat with delight under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, he will keep off his fathers diſpleaſure, you may eat and pluck, and eat with delight, and need not fear ſurfeit, all the fruit is fully ripe, here Chriſt hath bidden you eat without fear. It's the ſin of ſome, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that they eat without fear: but here's the commendation of this fruit, you may eat without fear. Men may eat too much of the fruit of this world, and get a ſurfeit, it may coſt many a Life and Soul, but here Gods people may ſtill pluck and eat, and eat and pluck, and eat abundantly.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42593:57"/>3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Thirdly, This Doctrine calls the Saints to thankfulneſs: Oh bleſs the Lord that he hath made ſuch proviſion for you, that he hath provided ſuch a Tree as this, that you may eat here, and eat in heaven, and for ever feed upon it, and be comforted, and ſatisfied; What do you owe to the Lord, you that are the people of the Lord? What do you owe to the Lord for his mercy? I ſay, what ſhall you render unto the Lord for all his loving kindneſs, when you pluck, and when you eat; look upward, I ſay eat and look upward. Do not eat as the Swine eat under the Tree and never look up from whence it comes; it's a ſin to receive any mercy, ſo to take them as not to look up; but when you eat of the fruit of this Tree, Oh lift up your hearts and look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt and be thankful; do but conſider what poor creatures you are, what need you have of this fruit, you had ſtarved, your ſouls had ſtarved and famiſhed for ever, if Chriſt had not been a fruitful Tree, all the creatures could not have given you fruit for your ſouls to feed on. I tell you the fruit that is upon the creature, is vanity, it's periſhing, they could not have nouriſhed you up to eternal life; Oh you had famiſhed, you had fainted, you had periſhed; and when you were in this fainting periſhing condition, he ſprang up as a Tree in the Wilderneſs, as a Tree in the Foreſt; he ſprang up in your fainting and wildred conditions, he ſprang up and became a fruitful Tree unto your nouriſhment. And do you but conſider what unfruitful Trees you were to Chriſt, when Chriſt became a fruitful Tree unto you; Oh the curſed fruit that you brought forth to him, you brought forth nothing but ſin and death, there's all the fruit that you brought to him, you brought forth ſin to him, and brought forth death to your ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42593:57"/> Oh that ever the Lord Chriſt ſhould be a Tree of Life unto you, you that were Trees of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelves, and Trees of Death unto him: your ſins put him to death: That ever he ſhould be a Tree of Life unto you, and be a Tree to bring forth ſuch fruit, ſuch peace, ſuch pardon, ſuch joy, ſuch ſtrength, oh the infinite love of Chriſt to you! Why certainly Chriſt deſerves a great rent for his fruit; it's ſaid in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 11, 12. That <hi>Solomon</hi> had a Vineyard, and he let it out for a thouſand pieces of Silver; if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſo much for his fruit, what deſerves Chriſt for his fruit? Oh the thouſand pieces of Silver, the thouſand Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannahs, the thouſand Halleluja's, and thouſand praiſes that are due to Chriſt for his fruit!</p>
            <p>Well, I beſeech you, give Chriſt of his own fruit, I ſay give him of his own fruit: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing from you, but what you may pluck from his own Tree; give him his own fruit: as it's ſaid of <hi>Cain,</hi> as wicked as he was, when the Lord bleſſed the ground, he brought of the fruit of the ground and preſented it as an offering unto the Lord; and now if <hi>Cain</hi> brought the fruit of the ground, ſhould not you bring the fruit of the Tree? The Lord hath given you all the fruit of the Tree to eat of; Oh bring of the fruit of the Tree as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that the Lord hath given you ſo freely to eat of; know that all your mercies come from this Tree, and therefore look that all your mercies, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and comforts grow upon this Tree: Oh then acknowledge Chriſt in all, and ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, O Lord all things come of thee, and of thine own have I given thee:</hi> So go and return all theſe mercies to Chriſt; if thou haſt any thing that is good, ſay, Lord this grew upon thy Tree, and I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42593:58"/> am beholding to Chriſt for it: if thou haſt any grace, any ſtrength, any ability, any opportunity to do for God, to ſerve thy Generation, ſay, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be Chriſt for it, it's none of my fruit, but it's Chriſts fruit, this ſtrength and that grace, it grew upon that Tree, I bleſs the Lord for it; Oh be taken up with admiration, with holy admiration; there is a world of precious fruit that grows upon Chriſt: you have heard but a little of it, oh be taken up with admiration, continually be taken up with thankſgiving and acknowledgement, give all back again to Chriſt, and by that little, that little ſight of the goodneſs, and the little taſte of the ſweetneſs that the Lord now gives you of the Tree of life, riſe higher, do not reſt here, but be riſing higher and higher, and ſay, Oh Lord if the fruit be ſo ſweet, what's the Tree it ſelf? How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and glorious is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Tree of life, from whence ſuch precious fruit doth grow? Reſt not upon any thing but Chriſt, and be ſtill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending higher and higher, and ſay, Lord if this fruit, the fruit that I now taſte be ſo ſweet, what is the fruit that I ſhall taſte of in heaven! If I taſte of the fruit of the loweſt boughs, and they be ſo ſweet, what is the fruit that grows upon the top branches, which is reſerved for the Saints to pluck, and to eat of when they ſhall come unto heaven? And thus I have given you in part to ſee the meaning of theſe words, and how uſefully they may be enlarged in your own Meditation, and remember the Text, it's worthy you ſhould ſpend many thoughts upon it: <hi>As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons; I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>HEre is <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion unto Chriſt about the Forgiving of Offences, and Chriſts Anſwer unto <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion; you muſt know that the Queſtion, and ſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer relates unto particular offences, perſonal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, ſuch wrongs and injuries as are done by one man unto another. As for thoſe which are more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately againſt God, and more publick, Chriſt doth give another rule in this Chapter: but this, I ſay, is concerning perſonal offences or wrongs which are done by one man unto another. <hi>How often ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive?</hi> It is true, every ſuch offence is a ſin againſt God, and ſo far as it is a ſin againſt God, there is no man can forgive:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42593:59"/> the Lord only can forgive ſin, he againſt whom the ſin is committed: but now there is an offence or wrong which is done againſt man, and ſo far as the offence is againſt man, man may forgive; man cannot forgive Gods part, but ſo far as the offence is againſt man, man may forgive it: nay Chriſtians ought to forgive it, ſo far to forgive it as not to ſeek any revenge for the wrong done. How often ſhall my Brother ſin or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt me?

It ſeems to be hard to forgive a brother ſeven times: but ſee how Chriſts anſwer doth exceed <hi>Peter</hi>'s, Chriſt will have no ſuch bounds ſet as ſeven times, <hi>I ſay not unto thee, till ſeven times, but until ſeventy times ſeven:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Wherefore doſt thou ſay ſeven times, to ſet the bounds of thy forgiveneſs ſeven times to thy brother? I'le have no ſuch bounds given: you think it a great matter to forgive ſeven times, I ſay unto you, That it is the Will of my Father that you forgive until ſeventy times ſeven: a certain number for an uncertain; ſeventy times ſeven, that is, I will have you to multiply forgiveneſs: not that Chriſt himſelf doth ſet bounds to ſeventy times ſeven, that they ſhould proceed ſo far and no further: but I will have you to forgive very often, nay, as often as thy brother doth offend, not ſeven times, but I ſay ſeventy

            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> How far the thoughts of the Lord and the waies of the Lord are beyond our waies and our thoughts in this matter of forgiveneſs; <hi>Peter</hi> thought ſeven times for a man to forgive an offending brother, was a great matter, but ſeventy times ſeven was not enough; and know that what the Lord Chriſt doth here give in as a duty unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and to all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that the Lord Jeſus himſelf doth aſſert as his prerogative in the matters of forgiveneſs, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of forgiving offences and tranſgreſſions. The Lords thoughts and the Lords waies are infinitely above ours. This truth I ſhall handle at this time, to make way for that main Doctrine of the Text, which is the Doctrine of Forgiveneſs, forgiving Offences. Now that the Lords thoughts, and the Lords waies, are ſo far above ours, it is clear from Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7, 8, 9. ſee it was in the matter of forgiveneſs this is ſpoken: <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he will have mercy, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon: For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your waies my waies, ſaith the Lord: for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my waies higher than your waies, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> Though you cannot think that I ſhould multiply pardon, you think ſeven times hard, but the Lord can multiply unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times ſeven; the Lords waies are not as your waies, nor his thoughts as yours, for his thoughts are above your thoughts, as the heavens are above the earth; now this ſhews us how far ſhort we do imitate the Lord in forgiving others: For</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42593:60"/>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, The Lord when he forgives, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives thoſe that are <hi>enemies;</hi> this will advance the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding riches of the Lords grace; I ſay the Lord when he forgives, he forgives enemies, for ſo is every man by nature; neither can any man lay down that enmity that is in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the heart, till ſuch time as the Lord Chriſt brings home a pardon, that is the firſt work and the ground of all that the Lord doth for a ſoul, and of what it doth for him: <hi>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſſes, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Now how far are the thoughts and waies of the Lord above our thoughts and waies in this matter of forgiveneſs! Chriſt he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives enemies, he brings home forgiving mercy unto enemies, and reconciles the enmity that is in their hearts; But oh how far come we ſhort? we are ſo far from forgiving enemies, as we can ſcarce forgive friends, hard to forgive a brother, a dear and near relation: Oh how far do we come ſhort of Chriſt in that?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord when he forgives offences and tranſgreſſions to a poor ſoul, he forgives <hi>freely:</hi> and the freeneſs of the Lords forgiveneſs, will appear in theſe particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, In that the Lord is <hi>alwaies ready to forgive,</hi> there is a propenſity in the heart of the Lord to pardon poor ſinners that come in to him, he is ready to it, God is never unready; it diſcovers the freeneſs of the Lord in this work: the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of the Lord in <hi>Pſal. 86. 5. For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all them that call upon him.</hi> Of tender mercies, God is never unready for this work, alwaies ready, ready to forgive, the heart of God is never out of tune, never out of frame for this work, never unready for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42593:60"/> this work, alwaies ready to forgive: but oh, how far are the waies of the Lord above our waies, for this, and his thoughts above our thoughts? Where is the man, or where is the woman whoſe heart is ready to forgive, whoſe heart is never out of tune, never out of frame for this work of forgiving wrongs, injuries and offences unto them that they do commit them? The Lord he is ready to forgive. It may be at laſt a man may be drawn off to forgive a man when friends have dealt with him, when he hath been urging it on his own heart to be his duty, when he hath taken pains with his own ſoul, and brought the Word home to his ſoul, and hath ſmarted for this unreadineſs to forgive: but oh, where is the man or woman that looks unto God, whoſe heart is never out of tune, but alway rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The freeneſs of the Lords forgiveneſs appears thus, In that he is not only ready to forgive, but he forgives at the deſire of the poor creature; no ſooner doth a poor creature expreſs his deſire, but the Lord is ready to expreſs his willingneſs, ſet forth in the Parable of the wicked Servant in <hi>Mat. 18. 32. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave thee becauſe thou deſiredſt me;</hi> not that this his deſire was the cauſe of forgiveneſs, but it expreſt the readineſs of the Lord at his deſire to come in, and to manifeſt pardon unto him. Now I pray let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far the thoughts of the Lord, and the waies of the Lord in this particular are above ours: for the Lord forgives that which is deſired; but oh, where is the man almoſt that can ſo eaſily forgive at the deſire of him that offends? hardly brought off, although the party offending doth deſire it, although friends have deſired him, and relations have deſired him, and God hath deſired him, and Chriſt hath deſired him, yet how hardly are they brought off to this work?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42593:61"/>3. Again, Thirdly, The Lord forgives freely: it appears thus, He doth forgive upon the confeſſion of his people, he is ready to manifeſt his pardoning and forgiving love, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 9. If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins:</hi> And hereby I ſay it appears that he forgives freely, in that he forgives upon the very confeſſion of his people, though not for confeſſion, and not for deſire, as I ſaid before; but yet in this way the Lord is pleaſed to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt forgiveneſs; no ſooner doth the poor ſoul confeſs, but he preſently forgives: <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaies <hi>David: The Lord hath done away thy ſin,</hi> ſaies the Prophet preſently, that is the next word. Now how far is the way of the Lord above ours? Where is the man that is ready to forgive upon a confeſſion? Yea, although there be an acknowledgement of the wrong done, yet how hard a matter is it for a poor creature to paſs by that wrong? Thus, how much are we unlike to God?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Nay further, the freeneſs of Gods forgiving mercy appears in this, He doth forgive <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as ſoon as his people look towards him;</hi> he doth not make long delay about the buſineſs, he doth not ſtand to conſider whether he ſhall forgive ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences or no, but preſently gives out pardon: <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaies <hi>David,</hi> and in the next words, <hi>The Lord hath done away thine iniquity:</hi> Now how far is the way of the Lord above us in this? Where is the man or woman that can find in their heart to forgive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the wrong or injury done? Oh there muſt be a great deal of do to bring off the heart to this work to forgive. It may be in length of time mens hearts may be perſwaded, through a long time they may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give and forget: but oh where is the working of grace, to bring off the hearts of men to forgive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42593:61"/> truly in this we come far ſhort of God, and the way and thoughts of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Nay further, The freeneſs of God in forgiving a poor ſinner, appears in this, He doth <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent poor ſinful creatures with pardoning mercy,</hi> Even before they do deſire, he prevents their deſire, their ſupplication for mercy, he brings in a pardon to a poor ſoul, before it hath made any real acknowledgement of its offence: <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my ſin unto the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 32. 5. <hi>And thou forgaveſt me the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin; David</hi> did but ſay it in his heart, he had but ſuch a thought, ſuch a purpoſe in his ſoul; well, I will return unto the Lord, and I will confeſs: And before <hi>David</hi> could do it, the Lord he prevents him, he prevents him with mercy. And ſo another Inſtance you have of the Prodigal in <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. He ſaid he would go to his Father and make his confeſſion; at the 18 Verſe, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee,</hi> &amp;c. and then at the 20 Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>He aroſe and came to his Father. But when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi> Mark how the compaſſion of the Father did prevent the confeſſion of the Son, <hi>I will go to my Father, and ſay, Father I have ſinned</hi> ſo and ſo, but before he could utter one word, the Father falls upon his neck and kiſſeth him, and forgives his many and great tranſgreſſions, and then indeed afterward he doth make an humble acknowledgement: And thus the Lord doth deal with poor ſinners, he doth prevent them with pardon, before they can acknowledge their tranſgreſſion; and how far is the way of the Lord above the way of man in this? Where is the man or woman that will deal thus with an offending brother,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42593:62"/> with one that hath done him wrong and injury, that will prevent their deſire, and prevent their confeſſion? but men will rather ſtand upon it, and think they have rather warrant ſo to do: If my brother confeſs and acknowledge his offence, then it may be we think it our duty to forgive, though hardly to bring off our hearts to that: but where there is no confeſſion and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, where is the man like the Prodigals Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to run and meet his ſon, and ſeal up forgiveneſs before confeſſion, or an acknowledgement? This ſhews that the way of the Lord in matters of forgiveneſs is far above man, the Lord forgives enemies, and the Lord forgives freely. But,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, The Lords waies are above ours, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that the Lord forgives <hi>fully:</hi> He doth not only forgive freely thoſe whom he doth forgive, but the Lord forgives poor ſinners fully: I ſhall make it out in theſe particulars. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, The Lord he doth forgive <hi>all the debts</hi> When God doth forgive a ſoul, he doth forgive all offences, all tranſgreſſions and ſins whatſoever: <hi>I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave thee all the debt;</hi> he doth not forgive one ſin to the ſoul, and leave the other to reckon with him for, and to condemn him for; but where the Lord forgives one, he forgives all, elſe the forgiveneſs of the Lord were not full. There are ſome that think indeed that God may forgive a ſoul one ſin, and yet reckon with him for other ſins: as the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, That God forgives Original ſin to all the World, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns for actual ſin; but this is contrary unto the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that grace of forgiveneſs: As Jeſus Chriſt died for ſins againſt the Law, ſo he died for the ſin of Unbelief; and when God forgives the ſin of the Law, he forgives Unbelief, and overcomes Unbelief, elſe it were in vain for God to forgive tranſgreſſion: though
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42593:62"/> God could forgive all tranſgreſſions againſt the Law, yet if God did not forgive tranſgreſſion againſt the Goſpel, we had been ſhut up eternally for that ſin; but when God forgives one ſin, he forgives all ſins, and herein is the fulneſs of his pardon; But oh how ſhort is our way of Gods way in this particular! A man can find in his heart to forgive ſome wrong, but to forgive all the wrong that a man hath done, this is a hard work: how hardly is the heart of man brought off to this work?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Nay again, The fulneſs of Gods forgiving mercy, it appears in this, He doth not only forgive all the offences, where the offences are few, but he forgives them all where they are many. If the ſoul be brought home to Chriſt the great Mediator, the great Sacrifice, the Lord forgives for all ſins though never ſo many, <hi>Luk. 7. 47. She loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her;</hi> though her ſins were very many, yet they were forgiven her fully: we can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a brother, a Neighbour, or a friend if they have done us but a few wrongs, but now when offences come to be multiplied, ſuppoſe they were many, Oh how hard a matter is it to us to forgive them, though eaſie with a Almighty God? But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, The fulneſs of Gods forgiving mercy doth appear, in that he doth <hi>forgive the greateſt wrong.</hi> He doth not only forgive many when they are <hi>ſmall,</hi> but he forgives many when they are <hi>great:</hi> and herein I ſay is the greatneſs of the grace and of the love of God towards poor ſinners, that although of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences be never ſo great, he pardons and forgives them all, <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, yet they ſhall be made as white as ſnow,</hi> Iſa. 1. 18. This is it that aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the offences of his people, in <hi>Iſa. 43. 24. Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42593:63"/> me with thine inquities;</hi> yet this follows at the 25 Verſe, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for my Name ſake, and will not remember thy ſins;</hi> this was it that did aggravate the offences of his people, thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins. God he forgives their ſins though they were ſo great, that God was oppreſſed under them as a ſervant under a heavy burden, and yet ſaith the Lord, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth them out:</hi> Oh how ſhort is our way of the way of God? It may be a man may forgive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences when they be ſmall, but when they come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them great, they are great wrongs done unto him, and never was any wronged as I am, by ſuch a one, and ſuch a friend: Oh how hard a matter then is it to imitate God in forgiving ſuch great wrongs?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, But again further, The fulneſs of Gods forgiving mercy appears in this, He ſo forgives his people as <hi>He retains no grudge in his heart againſt his people,</hi> nothing but clearneſs in the heart of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his people; <hi>Joſeph</hi> was one that forgave his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſo freely as he never retained any grudge: he takes off their aggravation; it was not you, but God that ſent me hither, therefore be not offended: <hi>Joſeph</hi> herein was a Type of Chriſt, he forgave his Brethren ſo fully as he bore no grudge againſt them, we never read that he upbraided his brethren ſo much as once, for all the wrong they had done to him, there was no grudge in the heart of <hi>Joſeph</hi> againſt his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there was nothing but clearneſs in his heart, and ſo nothing but clearneſs in the heart of God: But oh how do we fall ſhort of God? Men may profeſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, O they forgive their Neighbour ſuch a wrong: but oh is there not ſtill ſome old grudge at the bottom that is ready to break out upon all occaſions? How ſhort do we come of God in this reſpect? Nay</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42593:63"/>5. Fifthly, Further, The fulneſs of Gods forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth appear in this, That he doth not bear any grudge, he will not only not upbraid, but <hi>He doth receive thoſe whom he forgives into neareſt friendſhip and fellowſhip with himſelf.</hi> Though man did greatly ſin againſt God in <hi>Adam,</hi> and brake his firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Lord he enters into another Covenant, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, and in that Covenant he gives his people a nearer admittance unto himſelf than formerly in his firſt Covenant, nearer in Chriſt in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> than in the firſt; and truly when ever the Lord doth forgive a poor ſoul, and paſs by the failings and infirmities of his people, the wrongs and injuries which they do commit againſt him daily, yet he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it as fairly and as friendly with them, as if they had never broke Covenant with him; ſo did Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> though he did wrong and injury to Chriſt, yet the Lord Jeſus he doth admit him as near as formerly, he doth not only not upbraid him, but look upon him as his dear friend. Now how far is this way of God above our waies and thoughts? It may be you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a man that hath done you wrong, yea, but you will not truſt him; he was once your friend, but you will never truſt him with your ſecrets again, you will have an eye upon him, and watch over him as long as ever he lives: Oh! how far ſhort are we in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, of the forgiveneſs of God? But</p>
            <p>Again, The Lord he doth not only forgive freely and fully, but he forgives ſincerely, with all his heart: I will do you good with all my heart and ſoul: ſo the Lord doth not only profeſs with his lips, he doth not only ſpeak it in word, but the heart of God goes along with it, with every word of pardon: <hi>I know my thoughts towards you,</hi> in <hi>Jer. 29. 11. they are thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42593:64"/> end;</hi> he doth not only ſpeak peace, but his heart is full of peace. Oh how ſincerely doth God forgive! there is no hypocriſie, no diſſimulation, no deceit in Gods forgiveneſs: but oh how unlike are we in our thoughts and waies to God in this? There is many a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, ay, he doth forgive, he doth forgive another that hath done him wrong, but his heart doth not go along with his word, though he cannot but for ſhame profeſs, yet a mans heart doth check him, and tell him, he doth not really forgive even as God forgives, <hi>Pſal. 55. 21. Their words are ſmoother than Oyl,</hi> peaceable words, <hi>but war is in their heart:</hi> when a man is put upon it by being urged to it to forgive, it's a ſhame not to confeſs forgiveneſs, but it is not from the heart. But</p>
            <p>Again, When God forgives he <hi>forgives unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> When God pardons, he doth not pardon to day, and call it in tomorrow again: he doth not pardon to day and recall it tomorrow: <hi>I will be merciful to their ſins, and their iniquities will I remember no more, I will blot them out as a Cloud, as a thick Cloud;</hi> A Cloud that is blown away and ſcattered that it never come again, ſo doth the Lord give out pardon, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives unchangeably. Indeed the Papiſts, and ſome that follow them in that way, God he may forgive, ſay they, and yet viſit for tranſgreſſions, and afterward ſuch may fall away, and God may call to account and viſit for all ſins: but this is contrary to ſound Doctrin. That which is urged by them for the proof of this their Aſſertion is that Parable in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. that was ſpoken upon this occaſion of forgiving: ſome plead (upon this Parable) that God may forgive a man all his ſins, and yet afterwards calling him to account may reckon with him for thoſe very ſins: It ſpeaks of a certain man who ought his Lord ten thouſand Talents,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42593:64"/> but his Lord forgave him all the debt, and immediately he went forth and fell upon his fellow ſervant which ought him an hundred pence, and took him by the throat and caſt him into priſon, till he ſhould pay all the debt; whereupon it is ſaid, <hi>When his Lord heard thereof, he was wroth, and delivered him to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi> Now from this Parable ſome plead, That a man may be pardoned, and afterwards God may reckon with him for thoſe very ſins. But by way of Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Know it is dangerous to ſtrain every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: we are in Parables to look to that which is the main ſcope; it is not that God forgives ſins, and then calls to account afterward for them again; the ſcope of the Parable is, That no man can know he is pardoned of God, but that man that is ready to forgive wrongs and injuries done unto him: But yet they will urge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly this Parable, that the debt was forgiven, and yet he called to an account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I anſwer to that, That the Lord may forgive ſome temporal puniſhment; when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves a man or a people from temporal puniſhment, then God is ſaid to deliver from ſin, and ſo far this ſervant was forgiven, and any a perſon may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given ſo far, God may give out a promiſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſome temporal puniſhment, as he did upon <hi>Ahab</hi> his outward confeſſion; a man may be ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, that temporal puniſhment for a while may be repealed and held back, and a man by his own folly may pull down ſome greater wrath. And then</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, He was never made partaker of that pardoning mercy which the Covenant holds forth, which appears by the frame of his Spirit after he was pardoned, Verſe 26. <hi>Lord have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;</hi> it was no more than the forgiving
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42593:65"/> of ſome temporal puniſhment: he knew not what did belong to the Covenant of Grace, he was ignorant of Gods way in forgiving ſin, he was a Legaliſt; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this man was never acquainted with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, he did not know that he was a poor weak man, and altogether unable to make ſatisfaction to his Lord. And then</p>
            <p>Again, He was never made partaker of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy which the Covenant of Grace holds forth, as appears by the frame of his Spirit after he was pardoned. It was no more than the forgiving of ſome temporal puniſhment, his ſin was not pardoned by the Covenant of Grace, for if it had, he would have acted more mildly, and not ſo irregularly, and dealt ſo harſhly with his fellow ſervant.</p>
            <p>And it appears in that other word, in the 32 Verſe, <hi>O thou wicked ſervant;</hi> ſo that he was never made righteous with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for there he is called the wicked ſervant: ſo that you ſee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what was objected, that the Lord when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth forgive a ſoul, he doth forgive unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he doth not croſs the ſcore to day, and then call to an account for the ſame another day, but whom he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, he pardons for ever: how far ſhort is our way of forgiveneſs unto Gods? How hard a matter is it to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give unchangeably? <hi>David</hi> did forgive for a time, when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, then he made an humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, but upon another occaſion he commands his ſon <hi>Solomon</hi> to fall upon him, that <hi>Shimei</hi>'s head might not go in peace to the Grave: You ſee then that the point is made good, that the thoughts of the Lord, and the waies of the Lord in the matter of forgiveneſs, are far above the thoughts and the waies of man; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> thinks ſeven times to be a great matter, but Chriſt ſaies, not ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42593:65"/> A word for Application in brief to ſhut up all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Here is incouragement for poor ſinners to come in to Chriſt, there is mercy and forgiveneſs with him that he may be feared, and the thoughts and waies of the Lord in this particular, they are as far above your thoughts and waies as the heavens are above the earth; and oh what a wide open door is here! That the Lord would perſwade ſome poor guilty ſoul to come in to Chriſt by this door of mercy, forgiveneſs and plenteous redemption: though you have been ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and though your hearts be ſtill filled with enmity againſt God, yet know that the Lord is able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give enemies, and though you have nothing in the world to procure your acceptance, you can do nothing that ſhould commend you to God; yet know that the Lord he forgives freely, and though your tranſgreſſions have been multiplied, though very many, though very great, though you have made the Lord to ſerve with your ſins, and wearied him with your iniquities, yet he is able to blot them out freely for his own name ſake: Oh then that the Lord would perſwade your hearts to come, and to ſubmit to Chriſt, and not to go on in the way of rebellion, and take hold of that great propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory ſacrifice, and then you ſhall know that the Lord forgives, for he forgives you cordially and ſincerely; he doth ſo forgive your tranſgreſſions, as he will never remember them more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> And it ſpeaks a word of comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment unto ſuch poor ſouls as are in dark and ſad conditions: ſome poor ſouls that have look'd to Chriſt for righteouſneſs, and yet are found ſitting in darkneſs and oppreſſed with the weight of ſin; and becauſ (it may be) when you look into your own hearts, you find they are very narrow, when you are put upon this work of forgiving another, you are hardly brought off
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42593:66"/> to it, and certainly the Lord may for this withdraw himſelf; Oh know you have ſinned after profeſſion, and you have ſinned much, yea you have ſinned much againſt light, and that is that which cuts and makes great gaſhes: but yet know that the Lord gave Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Peter</hi> and his Diſciples to forgive ſeventy times ſeven; certainly that command which the Lord gave to man to forgive ſeventy times ſeven, he will certainly forgive poor creatures though their ſins be numberleſs. This is not to ſpur on to ſin, this is no word to invite to ſin: but this word of forgiveneſs is to the end the Lord may be feared and admired for his great grace; and take heed poor creatures you wrong not God of that which is his greateſt glory: It is the glory of a man to forgive ſeventy times ſeven, and the oftner the more like unto God; now do not rob God of his glory, that infinite mercy which put him upon it to forgive ſeventy times ſeven; ſay therefore as the Church did in <hi>Mic. 7. 18, 19. Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy: he will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and thou wilt caſt all our ſins into the depth of the Sea.</hi> You may look upon your tranſgreſſions, nay you ought to look upon your ſins, nay and to lye low becauſe of your provocations, and abhorr your ſelves in duſt and aſhes, you can never lye too low in the conſideration of your own vileneſs, none have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt ſo many aggravations, and ſinned againſt ſo much light and conviction; when you have thus ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated your ſin, do not rob God of his glory, but ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity,</hi> that forgiveth great iniquities, and many iniquities, who forgives ſeventy times ſeven.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Laſtly, This ſhould be matter of great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, that our thoughts and our waies are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the thoughts and waies of God in the matter of forgiveneſs; <hi>Peter</hi> thought it a great matter, What to forgive ſeven times? <hi>Peter</hi>'s number is very ſhort of Chriſts number. Yet where is the man or woman that is come to <hi>Peter</hi>'s number? and yet <hi>Peter</hi>'s number was ſhort of Chriſts number: Oh what cauſe have we to be humbled? One of the Evangeliſts hath it, <hi>If thy brother offend thee ſeven times in a day, and ſay, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him;</hi> Oh how far are we from forgiving ſeven times in a day? We are ſo far from forgiving ſeven offences in one day, as we many times remember one offence ſeven daies, nay ſeven years together; Oh how unlike is this to Chriſt? Oh let us therefore labour to walk up to the rule, or elſe never profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſts Diſciples. And ſo much for this time.</p>

                  <bibl>MATT. 18. 21, 22.</bibl>
                  <p>Then Peter came to him and ſaid, Lord, how oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? till ſeven times?</p>
                  <p>Jeſus ſaith unto him, I ſay not unto thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſeven times: but until ſeventy times ſeven.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Made entrance before into theſe words: Here is <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion and Chriſts Anſwer concerning the forgiving of offences, particular wrongs and perſonal injuries which are done to any man or woman. <hi>Peter</hi> propounds the Queſtion, and ſeems to foreſtall Chriſts Anſwer, by giving an Anſwer to it himſelf, which Chriſt did not approve of. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the main Doctrin, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. That the often forgiving of wrongs and injuries, is a duty which Chriſt commends unto, and commands all his Diſciples to follow: I ſay until ſeventy times ſeven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſhall clear this Point to you from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhew you from the word of the Lord, That this is a duty that is incumbent upon all that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I ſhall hold forth unto you divers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42593:67"/> of worthy and gracious men, who have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed this Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, And then ſhew you upon what ground Chriſt doth commend and command this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Look into the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where Wiſdom ſpeaks, which is Chriſt, <hi>Prov. 24. 29. Say not I will do ſo to him, as he hath done unto me, I will render unto a man according unto his works.</hi> Mark, here is the Counſel Wiſdom gives unto all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Say not I will do ſo to him as he hath done unto me:</hi> Do not ſay, I will be revenged of him for the wrong he hath done to me: do not ſay, I will give to him as good as he brings, I will recompence him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his work; ſay not ſo, no, Chriſt will tell you, and Wiſdom will teach all her ſcholars to unſay this Leſſon, you muſt learn to forget this Leſſon, <hi>I will do unto him as he hath done unto me,</hi> ſay not ſo; if you will be Wiſdoms Scholars, you muſt learn to unſay this Leſſon; indeed fleſh and blood ſaies ſo, and corrupt nature will bid you ſay ſo, <hi>I will do to him as he hath done to me,</hi> I will never put up theſe wrongs: Fleſh and Blood will not put up theſe wrongs: and the Devil will put you on to do as you ſay, but Chriſt would not have you. If you would be Wiſdoms Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars fear to purpoſe this in your hearts, much leſs to act; Why? what then muſt we do? See but what Wiſdom invites us unto in <hi>Matth. 5. 39, 44. I ſay unto you reſiſt not evil, but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other alſo;</hi> and again, <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you.</hi> Here Chriſt tells you what you ſhould ſay, and what you ſhould do in caſe of wrongs and injuries, namely, to render good for evil, it is the beſt way: look into <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. Chriſt would teach you your leſſon
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42593:68"/> if you would be his Diſciples; <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>take heed:</hi> Ay but what ſhould we take heed of? He doth not bid them take heed of the wrongs and injuries that others do unto them, that's not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt bids them take heed to; no, but take heed to <hi>your ſelves,</hi> look to your hearts, watch over your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and over your paſſions; when any wrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is done unto you, then you have need to take heed to your ſelves, you do no reſiſt evil, take heed you do not meditate revenge: you are in great danger of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God when wrong is done unto you, and therefore of all other Counſel, now take heed to your ſelves: ſee the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans 12. 17, 19, 21. Recompence no man evil for evil. Avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath,</hi> for it is written, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> Mark what counſel Chriſt gives here by the Apoſtle to all his Diſciples. Be not overcome of evil: When is a man overcome of evil (we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wrongs) When is a man overcome with evil? Why, when his ſpirit is put out of frame by the wrongs and injuries he meets withal, when he ſtrives to reſiſt and meditate revenge, then this man is overcome with evil. Whenas a man can paſs by the wrongs, paſs by an injury that is done, and his ſoul is drawn forth in pity and compaſſion towards that man that doth him the wrong: Alas poor man, he hath wronged his own ſoul more than me, I have cauſe to pity him more than to ſeek revenge of him: but now when as a mans paſſion is heightened, to give him as good as he brings, this man is overcome with evil. As it is with Fire and Water: caſt water upon the fire, if the fire be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, and ſo kept from burning, then we ſay the fire is overcome: but when the fire doth gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42593:68"/> its force, and doth continue its heat and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is as hot after as before, then the fire overcomes the water: wrongs and injuries are as water, now wrongs and injuries being caſt upon a man, quench his love, and that duty which he owes unto any man or woman; when as a man is taken off from his duty, hindred in the performance of his duty, his love is quenched, he cannot perform it: there is duty of love which he may owe to his Neighbour and brother; but now when this ſhall continue, and he is found doing his duty, though he meet with wrongs and injuries, yet paſſes them by, and love overcomes them, then doth he overcome evil with good: Take one place more in <hi>Col. 3. 13. Forbearing one another, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another. If any man hath a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi> Forbearing and forgiving one another, which is ſpoken to every man, If any man hath a quarrel, and if it be againſt any man whatſoever, Yet, ſaies Chriſt, it's your duty to forbear, and not only to forbear but alſo to forgive. A man may forbear, yet not forgive: forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, is the pattern that is ſet before us, which is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; even as Chriſt gave himſelf as a pattern, even ſo do ye, not only forbear but alſo forgive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, But the ſecond work is to ſhew you the example of many bleſſed ſervants of God that have been very eminent in this very duty, very ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give wrongs and injuries which were done by others unto them; and oh that by their example we might be drawn unto a holy imitation of them!</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Examp.</hi> And the firſt Example that I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>Joſeph: Joſeph</hi> was a man that had much of the Spirit of God, he was a man that received many wrongs and injuries from his Brethren, they could not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42593:69"/> endure him, they hated him, they conſpired againſt him, they ſought to take away his life: when they were prevented in that, then they ſold him, ſold him as a ſlave, and if the Lord had not been the more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to him, he had ended his daies in ſlavery and bondage; and this was from his Brethren, and yet we find in <hi>Joſeph</hi> a great readineſs of forgiving all thoſe wrongs and injuries which were done unto him by his Brethren: in <hi>Gen. 45. 5, 7, 8. Be not grieved</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>nor angry with your ſelves, that ye ſold me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for God did ſend me before you to preſerve life.</hi> And <hi>God ſent me before you, to preſerve you a poſterity in the earth,</hi> and to ſave your lives by a great deliverance; ſo it was not you that ſent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See how this good man doth not only forgive the wrongs and injuries, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to comfort his brethren, to take off their fears and to take off their grief: and therefore tells them, theſe three times together, it was not you but God, God ſent me hither, and God ſent me hither, and God ſent me for gracious ends; not a word that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of any grudge, or any ſpirit of Revenge: Nay, afterward whenas old <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father was dead, they might think now <hi>Joſeph</hi> would remember their old unkindneſſes now their Father is dead; in <hi>Gen. 50. 19. But as for you, ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it unto good;</hi> they beſought him that he would not remember their old unkindneſs: <hi>Fear not, am I in the place of God?</hi> Do you think I will take upon me to revenge the wrong, to revenge an injury? that were to ſet my ſelf in the place of God, <hi>Vengeance is mine, ſaies God,</hi> and <hi>I will repay it:</hi> God forbid that I ſhould ſet my ſelf in the place of God, you need not fear that I will do you wrong, that I will revenge me of you, God hath turned it for good, God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42593:69"/> hath turned it for good to you and me and more people, and therefore God forbid that I ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, to turn that into evil which God hath made for good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Examp.</hi> A ſecond Example for our imitation: And that is <hi>Moſes,</hi> a man full of the Spirit of God, a man that had great acquaintance and familiarity with God, God ſpake with him face to face; now <hi>Moſes</hi> he was very ready to forgive all perſonal wrongs and injuries. Many times when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmured againſt him, they laid all upon him: Thou haſt brought us from out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſlay us here in this place, and thou haſt done this wrong unto us; <hi>Moſes</hi> even at that time intercedes for this people in <hi>Numb. 14. 2. Moſes</hi> is ſo far from avenging the wrong, that he is the firſt man that ſteps in for pleading for this people at the 17, 18, 19 Verſes: and therefore he beſeeches God, that God would be pleaſed to paſs by this their tranſgreſſion! And there is one remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi> his meekneſs and readineſs to forgive wrongs and injuries done unto him, in the twelfth of <hi>Numbers</hi> in the beginning of the Chapter, it is ſaid, <hi>Moſes was very meek, he was the meekeſt man on the face of the Earth,</hi> he doth not reply one word. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake againſt him becauſe of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> woman that he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and ſaid, <hi>Hath the Lord ſpoken only by Moſes? hath he not ſpoken by us alſo?</hi> He doth not reply one word to them; they reproached his Wife, that he had married an <hi>Ethiopian;</hi> and that he was a man that had taken too much upon him: but <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not reply again, but God takes <hi>Moſes</hi> part, and calls <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> to ſtand before him, and God ſmites <hi>Miriam</hi> with a Leproſie, becauſe ſhe carried it ſo before him; and yet look into the 13 Verſe, <hi>Moſes cried unto the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42593:70"/> Lord, ſaying, Heal her now I beſeech thee; Moſes</hi> was the man that was wronged by <hi>Miriam,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> was caſt into a Leproſie, and now <hi>Moſes</hi> is the firſt man that ſteps unto God to plead for her: Oh his great love and readineſs that was in him to forgive and paſs by injuries, which made him to forget his duty to God, limiting him for the time, <hi>Heal her now, O God, I beſeech thee,</hi> let it be done <hi>now</hi> I beſeech thee; Oh here's a pattern, here is an Example for the imitation of all!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Examp.</hi> A third Example that I ſhall mention, is that of <hi>David: David</hi> a man full of the Spirit of God, and we find him a man ready to paſs by perſonal wrongs and injuries: Becauſe that <hi>Shimei</hi> had curſed him, ſome of <hi>David</hi>'s Worthies would have ſmote off his head, and <hi>David</hi> would not ſuffer them, <hi>It may be,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, God hath bidden him to go and ſay, Curſe David:</hi> This was a foul aſperſion caſt upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Come out thou bloody man, come out thou bloody man,</hi> ſee the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6, 7, 8. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 21, 22, 23. Whenas one of <hi>David</hi>'s Captains would have had him put <hi>Shimei</hi> to death, <hi>No,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I will not Revenge,</hi> but ſaies, <hi>What have I to do with you, ye ſons of Zerviah?</hi> He pardons <hi>Shimei,</hi> and ſwears unto him, That he ſhould not be put to death for this his Conſpiracy. And ſo in the matter of <hi>Saul, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was greatly oppreſſed and perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> though <hi>Saul</hi> ſeemed to be put into his hand, when he took him aſleep in the Cave, and had an opportunity to avenge his cauſe upon his enemy, yet <hi>David</hi> would not do it. It is true indeed <hi>David</hi>'s foot had almoſt ſlipt in the matter concerning <hi>Nabal,</hi> when he ſware he would be avenged upon <hi>Nabal</hi> for the affront done to him: but when <hi>Abigail</hi> comes and pleads with <hi>David,</hi> he doth accept of her counſel and bleſs God, <hi>Oh bleſſed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42593:70"/> be the Lord that hath ſent thee to withhold my hand from ſhedding blood, and from avenging mine own cauſe this day;</hi> and thus you ſee <hi>David</hi> was a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive and to put up wrongs and injuries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Examp.</hi> One Example more from the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and that is of <hi>Eliſha</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14. The King of <hi>Syria</hi> took an Army to apprehend <hi>Eliſha,</hi> now they came to the City where <hi>Eliſha</hi> was, to take it, and there God ſmites them with blindneſs, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> he comes and takes them and carries them into the City of <hi>Samaria;</hi> at the 22 Verſe, when <hi>Eliſha</hi> had brought the Army into the midſt of the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would have been ſmiting of them, ſaies he, <hi>My Father, ſhall I ſmite them? ſhall I ſmite them?</hi> Saies the Prophet unto the King, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſmite them; Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their Maſter.</hi> Though they came on purpoſe to apprehend him, and carry him to their Maſter and ſo to take his life, yet the Prophet ſeeks not to avenge himſelf of them; but on the contrary, requites them good for the evil they intended towards him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Examp.</hi> And ſo if we look into the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is ſome worth the taking notice of: As <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr, they did not only wrong <hi>Stephen</hi> in his name, but in his eſtate, and in his very life, yea, they put him to death: he was ſo far from ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, that the laſt words he breathed forth with his ſoul, I ſay the laſt words were, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge; and when he had ſaid it, he fell aſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Examp.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> take his Example, it is worthy our imitation, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. the <hi>Galatians</hi> had done him a great deal of wrong, they had under valued his Miniſtry, and ſet up
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42593:71"/> falſe Teachers in oppoſition to him, and the Apoſtle he was very free to forgive the wrong, ſo far as it was perſonal; declaring that he did acknowledge it not to be any wrong, 12 Verſe, <hi>Brethren, I beſeech you be as I am, for I am as ye are, ye have not injured me at all;</hi> here is a gracious ſpirit: I do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as any injury as it concerns me, I do freely paſs it by. Nay,</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Examp.</hi> We have not only the Example of man, but the Example of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: Oh the wrongs and injuries that were done unto Chriſt! What meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! What ſcourgings? what buffettings? what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings, what reproaches? inſomuch as the Governor wondred, What nothing to ſpeak for thy ſelf? And when he was to die, and giving up the Ghoſt, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Examp.</hi> That Inſtance of the <hi>Prodigals Father;</hi> The ſon had greatly offended him, done him great wrong, yet <hi>the Father runs out to meet him,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could ſpeak one word of confeſſion or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, the Father declares a readineſs of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſeals up his love and forgiveneſs, <hi>Falls upon his neck and kiſſes him.</hi> Thus you have ſeen the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of holy men, and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of paſſing by of wrongs and injuries. But now for the grounds of the Point: Upon what ground doth Jeſus Chriſt Commend and Command his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to this work and duty of forgiveneſs? Why firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> The firſt ground is, Becauſe he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them much, and therefore he requires that we ſhould forgive others, that ſo they that are forgiven of Chriſt, may teſtifie their love, and alſo their likeneſs unto Chriſt: and that is held forth in the Parable that follows the Text; the Lord there had forgiven the Servant that ought him ten thouſand Talents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42593:71"/> he expected that he ſhould have forgiven his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servant a few pence. I ſay all that are Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, all that are Believers, that do believe in the name of Chriſt, they have very much forgiven them of the Lord. There is no man but the Lord doth forgive a great deal of that temporal puniſhment which he might inflict upon them: now there is no Believer but the Lord doth forgive not only temporal but eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore there is an ingagement to us unto forgiveneſs: Alas, what are the debts and treſpaſſes done to us, or owing unto us in compariſon of what we have done, or what we owe unto the Lord? Our ſins are ſet forth by Talents, the offences and wrongs done unto us are ſet forth by pence: our ſins are ſet forth to be ten thouſand Talents, and the offences that are done unto us are but a hundred pence; when the Lord doth forgive ſo many tranſgreſſions, ſo freely, fully, ſo ſincerely, ſo unchangeably, the Lord doth expect that there ſhould be a readineſs in them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give others from a ſenſe of that forgiveneſs unto them of his, that ſo they may teſtifie themſelves to be the Children of their Father which is in Heaven. But the ſecond ground is this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe thoſe that we are called upon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give are our <hi>Brethren: How oft ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him?</hi> Chriſt Anſwers, <hi>Till ſeventy times ſeven.</hi> Now there is a great deal in the very name of <hi>Brother</hi> that may challenge forgiveneſs, and call us upon this duty; though many, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many, yet ſtill often and ever called a brother; for ſtill in one ſenſe or other; every man is a brother: ſome nearer than other, though not born of the ſame Parents, though not of Kindred, yet he may be a <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the ſame faith; though not a Brother in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, yet a Brother in the ſame Town, City, Country,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42593:72"/> or Nation; however in the ſame common nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of the poor, dark, frail nature eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man and woman is a Brother: but ſome relations more near than others. This ſpiritual relation, the ſame Profeſſion, the ſame Faith, the ſame God, the ſame Inheritance: this is a great engagement to paſs by and to forgive wrongs whilſt he is a Brother. The Lord when he forgives, he forgives inferiours; there is an infinite diſtance between God and the creature; when the Lord forgives a poor creature, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance betwixt God and man, but not betwixt man and man, and therefore upon this account Chriſt requires it. But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Thirdly, Another ground is this, If there be neglect of this Duty unto any of their Brethren, it will be a grief unto their fellow-ſervants, and they will make their complaint unto their Lord. It cannot but be a great grief of heart unto thoſe that are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants, when any that do profeſs the name of God, ſhall be ſo far from performing this Duty, that they ſhall expreſs a ſpirit of Revenge, and a ſpirit of Enmity: it will ſadden the hearts of many Saints, when they ſhall ſee one that is called a Brother, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, when they ſhall ſee him ſo unready to forgive, as he ſhall ſtudy wrongs and injuries, and ſtudy revenge; it will grieve them, and cauſe them many times to go to the Lord and make their complaint, There is ſuch a man that makes profeſſion of thy Name, and yet walks very unworthy of that profeſſion, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Fourthly, Again, Neglect of this Duty will hinder and keep back a great deal of good, and pull down a great deal of evil: Chriſt knew this very well, and therefore he did command this Duty, Chriſt knew that the neglect of this Duty would hinder
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42593:72"/> men of a great deal of good: It may deprive a man of many temporal mercies, of many temporal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; the Lord may call in the grant of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies, whenas he ſhall ſee ſuch a ſpirit in any that profeſs his Name, as to retain the ſenſe of wrongs and injuries, and not to paſs them by, it puts the Lord upon it many times to recall the grant of temporal mercies, as in the Parable fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Nay not only ſo, but it may deprive the ſoul of many ſpecial ſpiritual choice mercies: It may hinder the ſoul from beholding the light of Gods countenance. It is true, the ſoul being once pardoned by Faith in Chriſt, God will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call that pardon: Ay but if that man or woman that is pardoned, and they have the pardon ſealed and witneſſed, yet ſhall walk unworthy of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, and ſhall not come up to this Duty of forgiving, pardoning, and paſſing by wrongs and injuries, the Lord will recall the manifeſtation of his pardoning Love, and the ſenſe of it, though not the pardon it ſelf. It doth not only deprive the ſoul of much good, but it alſo pulls down much evil, and not only outward evils, but ſometimes the Lord manifeſts a great deal of wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon ſuch a one as is of an implacable ſpirit to retain wrongs and injuries; as it was with that ſervant that would not forgive his fellow-ſervant, the Lord commands that he ſhould be delivered up unto the Tormentor, and caſt into priſon until he had paid the uttermoſt Farthing: Why, a man though he hath but a profeſſion, the Lord lets him alone with that formal profeſſion till ſuch time as he comes forth with ſuch a waſpiſh peeviſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt Gods people, and ſeeks to wrong and injure them; Why, then the Lord he takes the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42593:73"/> advantage upon him, and gives him up unto the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor becauſe of ſuch a waſpiſh ſpirit, whenas he will not forgive a Brother a wrong or injury, but retain anger, he cannot find in his heart to forgive: the Lord ſometimes comes upon ſuch a man (though a Chriſtian) the Lord comes and takes him, and delivers him up to the Tormentor, delivers him up to his own Conſcience, though not to deliver him up out of his hand, but the Lord will deliver him up unto his own Conſcience, unto the manifeſtation of wrath, till he ſhall have made ſatisfaction, till he ſhall have cried out unto Chriſt for more ſtrength to carry it more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> But laſtly, Chriſt Commands and Commends the forgiving of wrongs and injuries, that ſo his Diſciples they may have room to act their Graces, and do ſome ſingular thing for the Lord; in the fifth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> when Chriſt put them upon this Duty, there ſaies Chriſt, <hi>What ſingular thing do you, if you love them that love you, what great matter is that? The Publicans do the ſame, the very Heathen do the ſame:</hi> Ye wiſh good, and do good to them that do the like to you, that is no great matter, But what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing do you? Chriſt would have all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to do ſomething more than the World doth, and he is a Monſter amongſt men that will not do good when he can, when good is done unto him: But Chriſt he would have his Diſciples, his people, do ſome ſingular good thing for him: The Lord hath ordered it, that they ſhall meet with wrongs and injuries more than any people in the World, for the trial of their Graces. Offences muſt come, there is need of them, great neceſſity there ſhould
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42593:73"/> be offences in this ſenſe, that wrongs and injuries ſhould be done, that the Lord by this might try and exerciſe the Graces of his people, there would be elſe no room for the trial and exerciſe, or at leaſt not ſo much for the trial and exerciſe of love, meekneſs, patience, forbearance, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, forgiving, and forbearing one another. If there were not wrongs and injuries, there would be no room for the exerciſe of theſe Graces, Chriſt would have his people put upon it to do ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing. As many a man or woman will ſay, Well, let me alone as I am, and I am as quiet as any man living, do not diſturb me, or do not wrong me, and you ſhall live as peaceably and as quiet as any people in the World: Ay, here's good Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but this ſavours not of Grace; Chriſt would teach his people to do ſomething ſingular; the World ſaies, Ye ſhall have blow for blow, and wrong for wrong, and injury for injury, but let them alone and you ſhall be quiet; here's no more than the wild beaſts in the Wilderneſs will here do, is no trial of Grace: where is your love, your meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your patience, your long-ſuffering? The Lord would have his people in the exerciſe of Grace, to do ſomething more than the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, May not a natural man do this, that hath meer nature, quiet nature, paſs by wrongs and injuries, and not render reviling for reviling, and wrong for wrong?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Yes, There is many a man will go a great way in this, that hath but good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But oh! what a ſhame is this to them that profeſs to have more than nature? Will not this be a ſhame and condemnation to thoſe that profeſs more than good nature, that they who have but good
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42593:74"/> nature may exceed them? And truly, that we may be aſhamed of our neglect, and provoked unto our Duty, I ſhall give you but two or three Inſtances of what men have done by good nature: And oh that the Lord would faſten ſomething upon us, either by what good men or bad men have done!</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Heathen Writers, it is written of that Sect of Philoſophers that were called <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> his Scholars, there was this Rule amongſt them, That when any offence was given by one to the other, the Parties offending and offended ſhould agree together and make up the breach before the Sun ſet, whatever the injury and wrong was: and now we let many a Sun ſet and not ſhake hands and cloſe hearts.</p>
            <p>There is another Inſtance amongſt the Heathens, which is very remarkable, of a Governour, and an excellent Governour: Upon a time, there was one of the chief Ring-leaders that ſtruck at this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and ſtruck out his eye, and he though but a Heathen, was ſo far from being revenged of him, as he takes this offender and receives him into his Family: And oh that this Heatheniſh man ſhould thus forgive him that had put out his eye, and yet we cannot forgive one that gives a blemiſh to our Name!</p>
            <p>There is another Inſtance you have in Scripture, and that is <hi>Eſau, Jacob</hi>'s Brother: <hi>Jacob</hi> ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, took him at an advantage, and got away the birth-right, and ſtole the bleſſing from him; and although his offences were very great and did ſtir up his paſſion againſt his brother, inſomuch as <hi>Jacob</hi> was forced to flee from his preſence; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, how freely doth <hi>Eſau</hi> put up all the wrongs and injuries done unto him, and how friendly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42593:74"/> doth he carry it towards him? Oh! how will <hi>Eſau</hi> condemn many that profeſs to be the ſeed of <hi>Jacob?</hi> Shall <hi>Eſau</hi> forgive ſuch wrongs and injuries as to have his Birth-right and the bleſſing taken from him, and yet we that are the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put up the leaſt petty wrong and injury! But I ſhould ſhew you the difference betwixt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mans forgiveneſs and the ſpiritual mans; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes of Conſcience, which I ſhall reſerve for a further opportunity.</p>

                  <p>Then Peter came to him and ſaid, Lord, how oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? till ſeven times?</p>

            <p>THere were two Doctrins raiſed from the Words, the firſt was this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> That the thoughts of the Lord and the waies of the Lord, in this matter of Forgiving Offences, are far above the thoughts and the waies of man, as far above ours as the Heavens are above the Earth. The ſecond was this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Doct.</hi> That the often Forgiving Offences is a Duty which Chriſt Commends unto, and Commands all his Diſciples to follow. I made it clear from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, both by Precept and Example of holy men of old, who have deſired to walk up to this Command of the Lord. But to proceed to the Anſwering ſome Objections concerning this point. It may be Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42593:75"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Firſt of all, How comes it to paſs that meer natural men may go ſo far as to out-ſtrip many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this particular, in the paſſing by of wrongs and injuries?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Firſt of all, There are ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men walk up to their principles; though there are no natural men (in all things) walk up to their light, yet there are ſome natural men walk up to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and it is true, a Chriſtian hath a more excellent principle than the natural man, which would carry him out (if well improved) far beyond all the actings of natural men; Ay, but when a Chriſtian doth not improve his principle; when he doth not walk up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Lord hath given him, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man doth improve his principle, and walk up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the natural man, the meer natural man, may be a ſhame unto ſome Chriſtians. A man that hath a principle of reaſon, he hath a more noble principle than a principle of ſenſe, yet if the principle of reaſon lie hid, and be clouded, it is poſſible that he may then act beneath a beaſt, and a natural man that hath but a natural principle, he may excel the Chriſtian that hath the more noble principle, by walking up to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. But,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, A meer natural man, that hath but a natural principle, may out-ſtrip ſome Chriſtians in this work of forgiving wrongs and injuries, becauſe there is many a natural man places his life and righteouſneſs in this, he hath nothing elſe to commend him to God, nothing elſe to truſt to for ſalvation, nothing elſe: He is quiet, peaceable, loving, and one that will do no wrong, rather put up wrongs and injuries, than do wrongs unto any: Now, whenas a man doth truſt to any of his works for life, it is a wonder to ſee what a great deal ſuch a man will do, whenas a man works for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42593:76"/> life; there is ſuch a deſire in ſuch men to work for life, and to work for righteouſneſs, and work for Heaven: It is very admirable to ſee what a natural man will do upon ſuch an account; Oh what a ſhame is it to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? yet there is no true Believer but is bound to do as much for God, and as much for Chriſt as if he were to earn Life and Salvation by doing: Chriſt having laid down his life for him, he accounts himſelf as much ingaged to do for Chriſt, as if he were to gain life by doing, it is a ſhame to Chriſtians to conſider what a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man will do for life and ſalvation. But</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, There is many a natural man will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip a Chriſtian in this, becauſe ſome natural men have the advantage of a natural diſpoſition; there are ſome that are more mild, and more peaceable, and more loving and gentle: ſome men are ſo, and do exceed others in natural qualifications: now ſuch a man hath a great advantage, whenas he is put upon ſuch a work as of paſſing by wrongs and injuries. The Lord many times, and for the moſt part, makes choice of, and brings in to himſelf the worſt of Natures, the moſt crooked, the moſt rugged, the moſt knotty pieces, the Lord is pleaſed to make choice of ſuch; and this is for the glory of the great Maſter Builder, for the glory of his Wiſdom, and the glory of his Power, and the glory of his Grace: I ſay this doth appear, in that he is pleaſed to make choice of the moſt crooked pieces of Timber for his Building; his Wiſdom doth appear the more in making theſe crooked things ſtraight, taking away the knottineſs, and unevenneſs that is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of poor creatures. But now a man that is of a mild nature, a ſoft diſpoſition, he hath a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it is no hard matter for him to paſs by wrongs and injuries; but now there are many of Gods people that have crooked natures, when God takes them to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42593:76"/> work them for his Building: Oh they cannot come up to their Duty without much ſtriving, ſtruggling, wraſtling, praying and crying unto the Lord: That is another cauſe why ſome natural men may exceed a Chriſtian in that work of paſſing by wrongs and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And then</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, A natural man may not meet with ſuch oppoſition from without, a natural man may not be ſo much hindred in this work when the Lord calls him thereunto: for the Devil ſuits his temptations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualification and diſpoſition of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where he ſees them mild, he will not put them upon ſuch rugged temptations; the Devil will let a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man alone and will not ſeek to hinder him, no, when he is in the practice of ſuch a good as this, for the Devil knows that theſe his works are nothing, and he knows that ſuch a man when he hath done never ſo much, forgiven ſeventy times ſeven, his beſt works are nothing without Faith, if he hath no intereſt in Chriſt; yet ſuch a one, I ſay, will out-ſtrip many a Chriſtian, which ſhould be our ſhame, and a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Again, A Chriſtian may forgive, and a natural man may forgive, the one may forgive as often as the other: But what is the difference? Oh a great deal of difference betwixt a gracious heart and a meer natural man; and I pray take notice of it, for it may be for the diſcovery of the great deceitfulneſs of mans heart in this particular. There is many a man may look upon himſelf as forgiven, and he may think he forgives a great deal, and yet God and Chriſt look upon him, and ſee he hath forgiven nothing at all! Well, the difference betwixt a natural man, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, in the forgiving of wrongs and injuries, lies in theſe particulars.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:42593:77"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt of all, A natural man may forgive wrongs and injuries, but it is not from a principle of love unto God in Chriſt, it is meerly from reaſons that are taken from himſelf; I ſay, the natural mans argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are from himſelf, they are out of the ſhop of reaſon, and not from the apprehenſion of the love of God, nor from any perſwaſion of his Duty, or any deſire that he hath to expreſs his likeneſs and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto God in Chriſt: I ſay, his reaſons are from himſelf; He may reaſon thus, Alas, this is unworthy of a man to expreſs wrath, to take revenge, or this will but diſturb mine own peace, this will but lay me open to others, it will but diſcover my nakedneſs, and frowardneſs, my paſſion which is my nakedneſs: He reaſons thus, Why ſhould I meddle with one that is ſo much beneath me, it will be no great conqueſt if I do overcome him? And thus his Arguments are from himſelf. But now a gracious heart, when God comes and puts him upon the work of forgiveneſs, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken all from God: By this I ſhall expreſs my love unto God, and my obedience unto Chriſt; by this I ſhall ſhew my ſelf like unto God, more conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Chriſt who is the Image of the inviſible God; upon this account, I ſay, a gracious man is brought off to forgive wrongs and injuries. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Again, A natural man when he forgives, it is in his own ſtrength that he doth it: when he ſets upon this Duty, it is in his own ſtrength; he is never ſenſible of the contrary workings of his own heart, which do lie in the way to hinder him; he is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own contrary motions that are in his own ſpirit againſt this Duty, he is not ſenſible of the need he ſtands of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to help him herein: and therefore he doth not make uſe of Chriſt, he doth not run unto the Lord and cry to him for ſtrength, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42593:77"/> reſt upon him for ſtrength to perform his duty: but now a gracious heart doth not move upon his own hinges, but is made ſenſible of the contrary motions and workings of his own heart and ſpirit unto this duty, he ſees how hard his ſpirit and heart is brought off to this duty, he ſees what need he hath of a better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and of further ſtrength than that he hath in himſelf, and therefore he runs to Chriſt, and cries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Oh Lord, ſaies he, here is an opportunity for me to expreſs my love to thee in the forgiving ſuch and ſuch wrongs and injuries, here is an opportunity for me to do ſome ſingular good thing for thee: but I have no ſtrength of my own, and therefore he cries unto the Lord, and waits upon the Lord for ſtrength; but as for the natural man, he is as the Ship upon the Sands, and beats and ſtaves himſelf there. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Again, A natural man when he forgives wrongs and injuries, he aims at himſelf; as ſelf is the beginning, ſo ſelf is the end: he forgives indeed, but it is not for Chriſts ſake, but for his own ſake, and oh it is a great deal that a man will do for himſelf, for his own credit, for his own reputation, that he may be taken for a good man, for a loving man, for a peaceable man, that he may not diſcover his nakedneſs: for his own credit and name a man will do a great deal, and ſo for his own eaſe, and for his own peace, that he may not be diſturbed in his own ſpirit, and he ſaies, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der evil for evil will be an occaſion of diſturbance to his own ſpirit, if he retains wrongs and injuries it will prejudice his health, and bring down his ſtrength; and ſo for ſuch ends a meer natural man may be brought to forgive: But now a gracious heart when he forgives, he eyes the Lord, and does forgive for the Lords ſake: he eyes the honour of God, and the glory of God, that ſo he may do ſomething for the lifting up of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42593:78"/> name of God, that truth may be well ſpoken of, that God and his waies and Chriſt may be well ſpoken of, that he may be lifted up in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Again, A natural man when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given wrongs and injuries, commonly he preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon himſelf, and is lifted up becauſe of what he hath done, and this tends to the nouriſhing of pride in his heart, and ruine of himſelf; as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Come and ſee my zeal for the Lord:</hi> And ſo in this caſe of a natural man, when he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given wrongs, Come and ſee my meekneſs, come and ſee my patience, come and ſee my long-ſuffering, there is no man would have paſſed by ſuch a wrong as I have done, and taken no revenge: you ſhall have it oft repeated by himſelf, and that's an aggravation after he hath done it, becauſe he makes it his work to lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But now a gracious heart acts contrary to this, he reflects upon the Lord when he hath been inabled to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give any wrong or injury, he deſires to give God the glory, he is ſenſible that if the Lord had left him, he had done as evilly as others: at ſuch a time my heart was boiling, and rolling up and down and meditating revenge, and the Lord was pleaſed to bring off my heart to this duty of forgiving wrongs, and then gives glory unto the Lord; and thus did <hi>David,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. whenas the Lord had ſent <hi>Abigail,</hi> and took off <hi>David</hi> from his purpoſe of revenging himſelf upon <hi>Nabal,</hi> at the 32, 33 Verſes; Oh how doth <hi>David</hi> give all the glory to God! and ſo he doth not take any thing to himſelf, but acknowledge that the free Grace of God was in it, and it was the hand of God that did keep him, his heart was as prone as any other; <hi>Oh bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be the inſtrument that God ſent to prevent me from revenging of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42593:78"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. Another difference is, That a natural man many times may forgive, but it is through length of time that he wears out the Impreſſion of the wrong and injury that is done unto him: But now a gracious heart doth not let nature alone to wear it out by length of time, but it is deſirous to ſet grace at work for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſilencing of that corruption which is boiling and ſtirring in the heart; you know <hi>Eſau</hi>'s heart was filled with a great deal of revenge againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet when <hi>Jacob</hi> fled and kept out of his preſence twenty years and more, at laſt <hi>Eſau</hi> begins to fall from that paſſion of anger, and when he comes to his brother he falls upon his neck and kiſſes him: There is many a natural man, may through continuance and length of time forget: But a gracious heart (though corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be boiling up) yet Grace will take hold of its heel, and will preſently be fetching in arguments, ſuch arguments as have been ſpoken of before, fetch'd from God, from Chriſt, from the love of God, from the command of God, from conformity unto Chriſt, and by theſe arguments laid before the ſoul, it is deſirous to come up unto its duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 6. Again, There is this difference, A natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man may forgive; Ay, but it is a hard thing for him to render good for evil, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o overcome evil with good: It is poſſible he may not revenge the wrong that is done unto him; Ay, but it is a hard matter to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evil with good. Now a gracious heart looks to the Commandment of Chriſt, of overcoming evil with good, and looks to the example of Chriſt, who overcame evil with good; and to the examples of the Saints, <hi>Joſeph</hi> did good for evil, and <hi>Moſes</hi> did good for evil, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> did good for evil, and <hi>David</hi> did good for evil; and he deſires herein to be a Follower of Chriſt, and to come up to his duty: Now, I ſay,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42593:79"/> it is a very hard thing for a natural man to come up to this duty; though he may forgive and paſs by wrongs and injuries, yet to requite evil with good, and to love them that hate him, and to pray for them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him and deſpitefully uſe him, this is a hard leſſon for a natural man. But then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. A third Queſtion is, Whether is a man bound to forgive wrongs and injuries, whenas a man doth not confeſs, when they are not confeſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged? The place that ſome make uſe of to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their corruption, is <hi>Luk. 17. 4. And if he treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> Therefore ſome think from hence, that they are not bound to forgive a man the wrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that is done unto him, when that they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. But to this</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, That a Chriſtian ought to forgive wrongs and injuries, though not confeſt. The ground of my aſſertion is this, Becauſe we are bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give as God forgives, and the Lord brings forth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before one word of acknowledgement can be made: As in that Inſtance, Before the ſon ſpake one word of confeſſion, the Father gave him a pardon, and ſealed up his pardon unto him, and fell upon his neck and kiſſes him, and then he makes confeſſion. Our rule and practice muſt be from God himſelf, that we are bound to pardon and forgive, though there be not an acknowledgement and confeſſion of the wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, How can I forgive him the wrong, that will not come at me, and hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou maiſt forgive in thine own ſpirit, there ought to be a readineſs in thy heart to forgive; as the Lord was ready to forgive, ſo thy heart ſhould
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42593:79"/> be prepared, and ready at all times for forgiving and paſſing by wrongs and injuries. Nay, it is not only required that thou ſhouldſt be in a readineſs to forgive: but the Lord requires that thou ſhouldſt paſs by wrongs and injuries, ſo far as not to meditate upon them, and ſo far as not to be hindred in holding forth love unto thy brother. And to ſay further in anſwer to this Objection, Whereas thou ſaiſt, thou can'ſt not; Why? Becauſe he will not come to thee. I anſwer, Thou art bound to go to him, if he will not come to thee: thou art bound to go to that man, or that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath done thee wrong, if they will not come to thee; in <hi>Matth. 18. 15. If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go to him, and tell him firſt privately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and him, and if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained a Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> This is ſtrange you will ſay, He hath done me the wrong, it is he that hath heaped injuries upon me, and what, ſhould I ſeek him firſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, If he will not ſeek thee, then thou muſt ſeek him: It is true, it's his duty to come to thee, but if he will not come unto thee, then Chriſt hath impoſed the duty upon thee to go unto him, and this is the pattern of God himſelf. Poor creatures, we had offended the Divine Majeſty, and we are far from coming to God, nay the louder God calls, the further are we from God, he purſues after them, they will not come to him, now he will come to them, by his Word and by his Spirit, and bring his pardon, and make them ſenſible of their fault and tranſgreſſion; ſo that what the Lord doth unto the ſons of men in this particular, it is for our imitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Again, There is another Query, or caſe of Conſcience, Whether may not a man, in caſe of wrongs and injuries, endeavour to right his wrongs; as, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42593:80"/> may he not uſe lawful means to right himſelf? Whether may he not go to uſe the Magiſtrate, or to the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A man may upon theſe cautions,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt to deal with him in a private way, and ſo to labour to convince him of his fault, ſo far as it is a ſin againſt God; now if a man cannot prevail in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way, then he may proceed further, he may take two or three witneſſes, and ſeek unto the Church. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Take this caution, That before a man doth this, he muſt be ſure to forgive it in his own heart as to himſelf, to paſs by the wrong and injury as to him, and to retain no grudge in his heart as to himſelf. And then further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Take this caution, In ſuch a caſe a man may not make himſelf the laſt end, and the great end for which he doth theſe things, for he is bound to ſeek the glory of God in the firſt place, and to do this, that God may have honour; and in the next place, he is to eye the good of his brother, that his brother may be reclaimed, that his brother may be convinced, that his Brother may ſee the ſin that he hath committed againſt God: a man ought to ſeek opportunity to right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not for himſelf, but he ought to eye the glory of God and the good of his brother, and then he may uſe ſuch lawful means as God lays before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> There is another Query, as a Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Whether may not a man that is wronged by another, go and ſpread his wrong before God, and complain unto God of the wrong and injury that is done unto him by another?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer unto this, That a man may go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord and make his complaint whenas others have done him wrong, but take heed it be not for this end, that thou maiſt be avenged of thy brother; if there be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42593:80"/> any deſire of revenge, nay, if there be any deſire that the Lord ſhould revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is not that forgiveneſs that the Lord calls his people unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay then, Why, upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may we ſpread our wrongs and injuries before the Lord? If we may not deſire that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them, and requite them according to what they have done unto us, to what end ſhould we make our complaints before the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, We may complain for this end, That the Lord might conſider us, that the Lord may pity us, that the Lord may deliver us, from the wrongs, and from the preſſures and grievances which are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, but there ought not to be a deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; ſee <hi>Prov. 20. 22. Say not thou, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence evil; but wait on the Lord and he ſhall ſave thee:</hi> What then, may I not go unto the Lord? Yes, for this end that the Lord may ſave thee, but not that the Lord may take vengeance for thee upon another: he doth not ſay, Go and wait upon the Lord that he may take vengeance; no, but wait upon the Lord and he ſhall ſave thee, he ſhall clear up thy good name, and make thine innocency to appear. But there ought not to be a waiting upon the Lord that he may take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for thee; this is far from that forgiveneſs which Chriſt calls for in the Text.</p>
            <p>Nay further, The Lord would have his people to be ſo far from deſiring revenge, that he would have them to pray that the Lord would forgive others the wrong which they have done unto them: mark thoſe Examples of Chriſt and <hi>Stephen, Father forgive them, they know not what they do;</hi> and ſaith <hi>Stephen</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin unto their charge;</hi> ſo that I ſay the Lord would have his people ſo far from ſpreading the wrongs and injuries that others have done unto them,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42593:81"/> that he would rather have them with Chriſt to pray, <hi>Father forgive them;</hi> and with <hi>Stephen, Lord lay not this ſin to their charge;</hi> and to <hi>pray for them that perſecute you, and that ſpeak all manner of evil of you:</hi> The Lord would have his people ſo far from ſpreading their wrongs before him upon this account, that the Lord would avenge them. The deceit of mans heart is ſuch that man will forgive, that the Lord may reward it, and revenge it; no, this is not the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but that forgiveneſs which Chriſt here calls for, ought to be a thorow forgiveneſs, to forgive ſo far as to pray for them, that the Lord would forgive their ſin unto them; that the Lord would not lay their ſin unto their charge.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>MATT. 18. 21, 22.</bibl>
                  <p>Then Peter came to him and ſaid, Lord, how oft ſhall my Brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? till ſeven times?</p>
                  <p>Jeſus ſaith unto him, I ſay not unto thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſeven times: but until ſeventy times ſeven.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOu may remember the Doctrin which we are inſiſting upon is, <hi>That the often forgiving of offences and injuries is a duty which Chriſt commends unto, and commands all his Diſciples to follow.</hi> Not till ſeven times, but until ſeventy times ſeven. I proved the Doctrin by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and held forth unto you the examples of godly men, who had much of the Spirit of the Lord; and the more of Gods Spirit was in them, the more ready were they to paſs by wrongs and injuries which were done unto them by their Brethren. I gave you the grounds of the Point, the laſt day I came to anſwer ſome Objections, and Caſes of Conſcience. But I come now to the Application and Uſes of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:42593:82"/>1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It is a word of reproof in the firſt place. Oh what a ſad complaint may we take up, that this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Jeſus Chriſt commands, is ſo little practiſed in our Generation! that there is ſuch an unreadineſs in the ſpirits of moſt men, if not in all men, to come up to this duty, a Goſpel duty, a hard duty; and oh what unreadineſs is there in mens ſpirits to come up unto the practice of it! Oh! how many are there in the World that do not only come ſhort of walking up unto this Rule, but do walk quite contrary unto it? And I ſhall ſhew you who they are: and oh that God would ſpeak convincingly unto mens hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, They walk contrary unto this Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Who are eaſily provoked unto wrath,</hi> who are ſoon diſpleaſed, who are ſoon put out of the way, take up every ſmall wrong, every petty offence, nay, are many times provoked unto wrath upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited injury, for a poor trivial buſineſs, that will make a man an offender for a word: Nay, it may be, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed for want of a look, or for want of a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Oh how contrary is this unto the Rule of Chriſt? Oh! how far are ſuch ſpirits from that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and that long-ſuffering that the Goſpel calls unto? Where is the grace of long-ſuffering? Nay, ſuch ſpirits, they are far from the exerciſe of the grace of Love, Love believeth all things, and hopeth all things, makes the beſt interpretation of all things: Such ſpirits as are eaſily provoked with every petty wrong and offence, they are far from the duty of the exerciſe of this grace of Long-ſuffering, and come far ſhort of walking up to this Rule that Jeſus Chriſt hath left for his Diſciples to walk in. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, They walk contrary unto this Rule of Chriſt, <hi>Who are retentive of thoſe wrongs and injuries, that are hardly appeaſed when once provoked,</hi> that will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42593:82"/> remember one wrong ſeven daies, nay, ſeventy times ſeven: when Chriſt ſaies, Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, let it not once go down upon your wrath, there are many that let the Sun ſet ſeven times, nay, ſeventy times ſeven on their wrath. Let me ſay to ſuch, I muſt needs ſay that ſuch actings are beneath the actings of a man; there is a heavy Judgement upon ſuch a man; or ſuch a woman, a heavy Judgement is upon them, and they know not of it; I ſay ſuch as can retain wrongs or injuries, think of them ſeventy times ſeven daies, ſpeak of them ſeventy times ſeven, a Judgement will belong unto them, ſuch a Judgement as was upon <hi>Nebuchadnezar, Dan.</hi> 4 32. Truly I may ſay of ſuch men and women, this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is upon them in a ſpiritual ſenſe: He was turned out from among men to dwell with the Beaſts, his reaſon was taken from him, and he was caſt out ſeven times, yea ſeven years among the beaſts. I ſay it of ſuch men and women that have this ſpirit reigning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, whenas anger lodgeth in their hearts, they are turned out as among the beaſts; what a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it to be turned out among the Beaſts daies and years together? and ſo is every one judged of God, till they ſhall come to know that the moſt high ruleth over all, and that he hath taught them this leſſon, To forget, and to forgive. But let me ſay again of ſuch, Whilſt paſſion ſo reigns, they give entertainment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan that foul and unclean ſpirit: when ever anger and wrath lodgeth in any mans heart, the Devil lodgeth there too; ſee it in <hi>Epheſ 4. 26, 27. Be angry and ſin not; let not the Sun go down in your wrath, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give place to the Devil.</hi> That man that lets anger lodge in his boſom all night, gives entertainment that night to the Devil. There is many a man, and many a woman in the world in word will bid defiance
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42593:83"/> to the Devil or Satan, and yet they open their boſom, their breaſt, and their doors, and give entertainment unto Satan; for where anger and wrath lodgeth in any mans boſom, the Devil will certainly creep in, they cannot be parted; theſe two will go together: If there be anger one night, that night the Devil will be there too; And oh! that we may not be found to give entertainment unto ſuch a Gueſt as Satan is: But they do give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment unto him, that are retentive of wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, How contrary do they walk unto the Rule of Chriſt, <hi>That do aggravate all offences which are done unto them:</hi> aggravate all wrongs and all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and do improve them to the uttermoſt, and make the worſt of them? So did <hi>Laban</hi> whenas he purſued after <hi>Jacob</hi> when he returned to his own Country, <hi>Gen. 31. Laban</hi> purſues after him, 26, 27, 30 Verſes, <hi>What haſt thou done, that thou haſt ſtolen away una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares to me, and carried away my daughters, as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives taken with the Sword? Wherefore didſt thou flee away ſecretly, and ſteal away from me, and didſt not tell me?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yea thou haſt ſtolen away my Gods.</hi> See here's a man that aggravates all to the utmoſt; twice, thrice, <hi>Thou haſt ſtolen away, and ſtolen away, and carried away my Daughters as Captives, and thou haſt ſtolen away my Gods:</hi> Oh, ſuch a Spirit is far unlike unto the Spirit of God. The Lord Jeſus calls offences againſt men, <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> and ſo Chriſt would have us to look upon them as Treſpaſſes, as errors, and not to aggravate them, nor to look upon them as ſins of preſumption; Oh! that ſuch hearts were but as ready to aggravate their own offences againſt God! We ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate all wrongs and all injuries which are done againſt us, but we are but little in aggravating our ſins and our tranſgreſſions againſt the Lord; Oh that men
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42593:83"/> could but aggravate both their own ſins and the Lords mercies, as they are ready to aggravate the offences of their Brother. We commit many ſins againſt the Lord, and do not aggravate them, we receive many mercies from the Lord, and do not aggravate them: we do not compaſs our mercies, and tell the Towers of them, and behold the goodneſs of the Lord in them; and yet oh how ready are we to aggravate our wrongs, and compaſs them round again and again, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them to the uttermoſt? Oh! how far do ſuch come ſhort of walking up to the rule of Chriſt? And let it be conſidered, what ſhould become of poor creatures. If the Lord ſhould aggravate thy offences as thou doſt thy Brothers, and ſet them before thee withall the aggravation of them, how ſad would it be unto thee? Oh! that we might not improve and aggravate all to the height, for that ſpirit is very unlike unto Jeſus Chriſt. Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, They are far from this rule <hi>That are hardly brought off unto reconciliation;</hi> that although there be confeſſion, and although there be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement ſometimes, though they that have offended be ready to acknowledge the offence, and do ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; nay, although friends intercede, and friends plead that they would be reconciled; nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God ſteps in, and Chriſt pleads, and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches, and Chriſt commands, and God ſets a mans Conſcience upon him, and that ſpeaks unto him, and lets him know he is out of the way, yet how hard is it for a man to bring off his heart into a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his Brother, after ſome wrongs and injuries which are done unto him; and oh, how unlike is this to God, and how contrary is this unto the rule which Chriſt here commends unto, and commands his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to follow? But,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42593:84"/>5. Fifthly, Again, They are far from this Leſſon, that inſtead of being reconciled or ſatisfied, <hi>Will not be pacified, till they do avenge the wrong which is done unto them with their own hand;</hi> they will render one evil word for another, reviling for reviling, and one evil turn for another, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: Nay, are there not ſome men, that are not aſhamed to profeſs this before all the World, that they will put up no wrongs, no injuries, but they will give as good as they bring, and if you provoke me I can be as hot as you: is not this the language of the World? Oh Sirs! this is curſed ſpeaking, and curſed acting, altogether contrary to Chriſts rule, for a man to avenge with his own tongue, and his own hand; Oh curſed be the wrath of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> whenas they would avenge (that wrong that was done unto their Siſter) with their own hands. Nay, let ſuch men and women conſider that they do but profeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the World their likeneſs unto the Devil, while they do ſpeak and while they do act; I can be as hot as you, and I can give as good as you can bring; what is that but in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſay, I can be as like the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as you? How far is this from a gracious heart, I can put up as many wrongs as you, and can commit my Cauſe unto the Lord? This makes you like to God, and the other like to the Devil himſelf. Nay, let ſuch men and women conſider, He that gets the beſt of it in ſuch conteſts when mens wrath is ſtirred up, why truly alwaies he that gets the beſt of it, hath the worſt of it; that man that got the victory, he is overcome: It may be he gains his luſt, he may gain his will and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his luſt, but he may loſe his peace, he may not ſatisfie his own heart, nor his conſcience; but alwaies he that hath the beſt of it, goes with the worſt of it. Now ſuch as will paſs by wrongs and injuries, till they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42593:84"/> do requite them word for word, and wrong for wrong, they do walk contrary unto this rule which Jeſus Chriſt hath given unto his Diſciples. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly and laſtly, They come ſhort of Chriſts rule, <hi>That cannot come up to Chriſts number.</hi> We are willing to forgive one or two wrongs it may be, but oh, how hard it is to come up to Chriſts number, to forgive ſeventy times ſeven, four hundred fourſcore and ten wrongs unto one man! Oh where is the heart that can come up to this number of Chriſts? Nay, there is ſuch an averſeneſs unto the practice of this duty which Chriſt doth command, as it is a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Chriſts people to believe it is their duty; ſee what the Diſciple ſaid when Chriſt had told him his duty, in <hi>Luk. 17. 4, 5. And if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again unto thee, ſaying, I repent: thou ſhalt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him.</hi> And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Faith.</hi> When he ſaid, <hi>Forgive ſeven times in a day,</hi> it's a hard matter to bethink it a duty, now Lord increaſe our Faith; Now, if it be ſo hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it a duty, oh how hard is it to come up to the practice of it? Surely, if the beſt men in the World had been put upon it, to have given Anſwer to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion, they would never have anſwered as Jeſus Chriſt hath anſwered; there is never a man upon earth would have ſaid, Thou muſt forgive ſeventy times ſeven: But the thoughts of the Lord, and the waies of the Lord, are infinitely above our thoughts and our waies: it is a hard matter for us to forgive ſeven times, and if hard to forgive ſeven times, then how hard to forgive ſeventy times ſeven? Oh, that the Lord would make us ſenſible of our great coming ſhort of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that the Lord would humble us, lay us low, that we have come ſo far ſhort of this rule which our
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42593:85"/> Lord Jeſus hath left us and all his Diſciples to follow and practiſe in paſſing by wrongs and injuries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> But the next Uſe is an Uſe of Exhortation. Firſt, I ſhall ſpeak to thoſe that have done wrong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their brother. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, To them that have received wrongs from their brother.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, To them that have done wrong unto others, that have injured their brother, or brethren, either by word or action, done them wrong in their Name or Eſtate, or any other way; Know that it lies upon you, and is your duty to go and ſeek recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: It lies upon you that have done wrong, to go and tender ſatisfaction for the wrong which you have done unto your brother, at leaſt to make acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the wrong and injury which you have done: And to preſs you unto this duty which is hard,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Conſider you that have done wrong to others, It may be thou haſt put the ſpirit of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Neighbour out of frame, and thou haſt unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for all duty, either unto God or man; thou by thy injury haſt ſtirred up his paſſion, and his paſſion hath opened a door unto the Devil, and the poor ſoul is expoſed unto manifold temptations and ſnares: and oh! how is he filled with hard thoughts, with hard thoughts it may be not only of thee but of the way of God, and of the truth of God, filled with hard thoughts againſt Chriſt himſelf? And although it will be very ſad, and a woe unto that man that ſhall be ſo offended; woe to him that ſhall be offended at Chriſt for the miſcarriages of men; woe to him that ſhall be offended at the truth, or any of the waies of truth from the miſcarriages of men: but yet know thou that haſt done the wrong, and art the occaſion of this, thou art under a woe; and <hi>Woe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42593:85"/> alſo unto him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>by whom the offence cometh.</hi> And therefore know, that it lies upon thee as thy duty to go and ſeek to deliver thy brother out of the ſnare, thy going and tendering ſatisfaction unto him may break the ſnare of the Devil for him: thou maiſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a multitude of ſins, and therefore oh that God would perſwade ſuch to come up to their duty. In a word, either he that thou haſt offended or wronged, carries it impatiently, or bears it patiently a while: now if he bears it impatiently, and his ſpirit be put out of frame, and he begin to fret and fume in his ſpirit, and be thereby indiſpoſed unto his duty, then by thy going thou maiſt break the ſnare of the Devil for him; but if he carry it patiently, and his ſpirit be ſilent before the Lord under thoſe wrongs and thoſe injuries which thou haſt done him, thou haſt the more need then to go and make acknowledgement of the wrongs thou haſt done, for certainly God himſelf will ſtep in on his part that is wronged, that bears the wrong patiently, and is quiet in his ſpirit before the Lord, the Lord will engage againſt thee; though he be ſilent, yet the wrong which thou haſt done to others, unto ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman, it will cry very loud before the Lord; and woe be unto thee if God ſhall ſtep in and ingage againſt thee; if God be for a man, who can be againſt him? if God be for him, better to have all the world engaged againſt him, than God to engage againſt him; therefore go and acknowledge thy error before thy brother: for if not, the Lord will engage againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, And then again, Conſider the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and examples of holy men in Scripture that have given ſatisfaction, and acknowledged their error to the full when they have done wrong: as <hi>Jacob,</hi> he had done indeed a great deal of wrong, ſinned againſt God,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42593:86"/> as well as againſt his Brother, in getting, or cheating his brother of the bleſſing: well, the good man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth again to his brother, and oh how ſubmiſſive is he unto his brother? He ſends many a Preſent before him to appeaſe his wrath, and how many ſoft words does he give him, in <hi>Gen. 3. 3. 5, 8. This is to find favour in the ſight of my Lord; and theſe are the Children which the Lord hath graciouſly given thy ſervant;</hi> and how many ſoft words doth he give unto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau?</hi> By which the wrath of <hi>Eſau</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed. And ſo you ſee <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, when they ſinned againſt their brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> oh how free were they to make an acknowledgement of their wrong which they had done him, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 17, 18, 19, 20. they came and made an humble acknowledgement of all the wrongs they had done unto him: <hi>For give, I pray, the treſpaſs of thy Brethren, and their ſin,</hi> &amp;c. And at the 18 Verſe it's ſaid his Brethren wept, and fell down before his face, and ſaid, <hi>Behold we be thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> and thus they make ſupplication that he would forgive the wrong. And ſo did <hi>Job</hi>'s friends, they had done him great wrongs, they had judged of his eternal eſtate, they concluded he was a hypocrite, they told him ſo to his face, they added grief to his ſorrow, great was his affliction, they had done him a great deal of wrong: Well, but in concluſion, when God doth convince them of it, they make acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their evil unto <hi>Job,</hi> as in <hi>Job</hi> 42. 8. So then you ſee it lies upon you that have done wrong unto your Brother, to go and make acknowledgement of the wrong that you have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, And let me ſay this further to you, to ſtir you up to this your duty, That all the Works which you perform in the ſervice of the Lord, they are loſt till ſuch time as you ſubmit unto this duty, to go
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42593:86"/> and ſeek reconciliation; ſee <hi>Matth. 5. 23, 24. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Mark, wouldſt thou bring thy gift, leave thy gift before the Altar, the Lord will not accept it, till thou beeſt reconciled to whom thou haſt done the wrong; leave thy injury there, I will have none of it till thou haſt done ſo: The Lord doth not ſay, go and carry away thy gift, but leave it there. There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man is taken off from his duty to God, becauſe he cannot bring off his heart to this duty to man, and inſtead of leaving his gift, he carries away his gift. Go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come again: the Lord would have you do it, and have it done inſtantly, go and do it ſpeedily, do it quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of offering be paſt; the Lord will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive gifts and offerings from that hand, or from that tongue that hath done wrong unto his brother, until ſuch time as there be an acknowledgement, till ſuch time as there be a reconciliation. So much for that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which concerns thoſe that have done wrong unto others, you ſee what neceſſity doth lie upon them, that they ſhould go and acknowledge the wrong and ſeek reconciliation.</p>
            <p>But a ſecond Exhortation is to them that are wronged, and have received injury from others. The Lord by this Doctrin calls upon you to expreſs your readineſs to forgive and paſs by wrongs and injuries: he would have you to forgive, and to forgive often; for Chriſts ſake be you willing to paſs by all wrongs and injuries which are done unto you. And I pray conſider, That you have an opportunity here to expreſs your Love unto Chriſt: I ſay, you that are Chriſts people, when
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42593:87"/> ever any wrong or injury is done unto you by Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Brother, Oh! then remember you have an opportunity of expreſſing your love to Chriſt, of ſhewing your obedience unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in a Goſpel truth, you have an opportunity of doing ſome ſingular thing for Chriſt, and therefore take heed you do not loſe the opportunity.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Here will be ſome Objections (for a great deal will be objected by corrupt nature) but I ſhall endeavour to take them off all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But you will ſay, He hath done me the wrong, it is a hard matter for me to go to him, or to forgive the wrong or injury which he hath done to me, fleſh and blood will not ſubmit unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To which I ſay, Though fleſh and blood will not ſubmit unto it, yet Chriſts Diſciples muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto it; if thou beeſt one that doſt profeſs nothing but fleſh and blood, I ſhall need to preſs this no further to you, for you will never come up unto it: but if thou beeſt one that doſt profeſs ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, <hi>Then are ye my friends,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>and my Diſciples, if you do whatever I command you:</hi> Then, when you yield obedience unto the command of my Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. And let me ſay further, If he hath done thee wrong, and thou ſeekeſt him firſt, thy acting it ſhall be moſt like unto God, for ſo God acts towards the ſons of men: the ſons of men had wronged God, God ſtoops firſt, he ſeeks reconciliation firſt, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. As though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled unto him:</hi> though he be the wronged, yet he acts firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. And let me tell thee further, That the more thou ſtoopeſt to him that hath wronged thee, the more peace will redound to thine own ſpirit another day; it is a hard duty when thou lookeſt upon it at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42593:87"/> but when the Lord helps thee to come up to it, thou ſhalt have moſt peace in it: and when ever it be over, it will never repent thee that thou didſt ſeek that man that hath done thee the wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Ay, But it will be Objected further: He hath done me that wrong that cannot be repaired, he hath wronged me in my good name; oh his words have been as ſharp Arrows, and they have wounded ſecretly: If he had broken my head, I could have born it, that would have been healed again, but he hath wounded my good name, taken away my good name, and therefore herein it is hard for a man to come up to this duty of forgiving of ſuch wrongs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But to this I Anſwer, Thou ſpeakeſt of Arrows that ſhall wound thee in thy name: Oh but they are not worſe than thoſe which wounded Chriſt: they wounded him in his name, in his good name, they reproached him, and reviled him, yet he cried out, <hi>Father forgive them:</hi> they are not ſharper than thoſe Arrows that <hi>David</hi> met with all over, when his good name was wounded; when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, he calls him a bloody man; Come out thou bloody man, here is a ſharp Arrow: Ay, but <hi>David</hi> paſſeth by that wrong and injury in obedience to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. And I deſire thee in the ſecond place, to Conſider that thoſe Arrows are not ſhot without Gods hand, the Lord hath a hand in it, and therefore eye the hand of God: If Gods hand had not been in it, he could not have opened his mouth againſt him. <hi>David</hi> conſidered that when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, ſaies he, <hi>It may be God hath ſaid unto him, Go and curſe David;</hi> and ſo his ſpirit ſubmits unto it: Ay, <hi>David</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is a righteous thing with God, for I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt, I have wounded the name of that Lord by my tranſgreſſions: And therefore it is a righteous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42593:88"/> thing with the Lord that my name ſhould be wounded with theſe Arrows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. And let me ſay further, That as God hath a hand in it, ſo the Lord might have ſhot worſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows againſt thee; the Lord might have ſhot the arrows of his diſpleaſure againſt thee: the Lord hath ſhot with mans arrows upon thy name; but what if the Lord doth ſhoot off his arrows upon thy ſpirit, a wounded ſpirit who can bear? And know if thy ſpirit be not brought off to paſs by thoſe wrongs and injuries which are done unto thy brother, the Lord may wound thy ſpirit, even as he ſuffers men to wound thy good name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But thirdly, It will be objected further, (for it is a very hard thing to come up to this duty, and there are many cavils) and ſome will ſay, The wrong which he hath done me, it is known unto others: If it were private I could paſs it by: But what will others think of me if I paſs it by? they will ſay I am guilty, and I ſhould be counted a Child, or a Fool to paſs by ſo many wrongs, and ſuch open wrongs and injuries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I Anſwer, Thou ſaieſt thou ſhalt be counted a Child, when Chriſt ſaith thou muſt be counted a Child, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. If ever you will get to Heaven, you muſt be converted and become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children; do not ſtand upon that, that you muſt be as a Child; no, thou muſt become a Child in theſe things, or no entrance into Heaven: as the Apoſtle ſaid in 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 20. Brethren, be not Children in underſtanding: howbeit, in malice be Children:</hi> Be not Children in underſtanding unto God, but unto men in malice be Children; the Lord would have his people be as far from ſeeking revenge, as a young Child: In malice be as Children.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42593:88"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. And whereas thou ſaieſt, Thou ſhalt be accounted a fool, to put up every wrong and injury, men will account thee a fool for thy labour; I tell thee, thou ſhalt be accounted a fool by none but thoſe that are ſo themſelves: for the Lord doth account it a point of Wiſdom, high Wiſdom; ſee what the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Prov. 14. 29. He that is ſlow to wrath is of great underſtanding, but he that is haſty in ſpirit exalteth folly.</hi> See now who is a fool, he that puts up wrong, or he that is haſty in ſpirit to avenge himſelf. The Word of the Lord ſaies, He that is haſty in ſpirit, he is the fool; he that will prevent anger, he that is ſlow to wrath, he is of great underſtanding whatever men account of him: in <hi>Prov. 19. 11. The diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to paſs over a tranſgreſſion;</hi> whereas thou ſaiſt it will be thy diſgrace, the Lord ſaies it ſhall be a mans glory to paſs by wrongs and injuries. Many a man whilſt he ſeeks to ſhun the name of a fool, he becomes a fool by giving way to wrath, and being drawn on to wrath and revenge he becomes a fool; think of it, is it not better to be accounted a fool than to become a fool, when anger lodgeth in the boſom of fools?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. Ay, but it is further Objected, Some will ſay I never did him wrong in my life, he hath abuſed me ſo and ſo, and I never did him the leaſt wrong in all my daies: here is a hard task. Well, in Anſwer to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt of all, The Lord may ſay the ſame of thee, if thou beeſt one that the Lord hath forgiven: the Lord may ſay, Oh, I have done ſuch a man good ſo and ſo, and he hath rebelled and ſinned ſo againſt me; I ſay, may not the Lord urge this againſt every one of us? I have done this and that for him, and I have never done him wrong, yet he hath done
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42593:89"/> thus to me: notwithſtanding which, the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives thoſe tranſgreſſions. And let me ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Further, That this will be more praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and more acceptable unto God; in 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. It is better if the will of God be ſo, that you ſuffer for well doing, than for evil doing:</hi> If you ſuffer as evil doers, you will have little comfort in it; but if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in well doing, take it patiently, and the more patiently you take it, the more acceptable it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Ay, but I have been a friend unto him (thus will men ſtand to plead for their paſſions, a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is to forgive) I have been a friend unto this man, I have done him good all my daies, and yet he hath wronged me ſo and ſo nevertheleſs; To which I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thou haſt the more cauſe to pity him, if he be one that doth return evil unto thee for thy good, thou haſt the better end of the ſtaff; ſee what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies in <hi>Prov. 17. 13. Whoſo rewardeth evil for good, evil ſhall not depart from his houſe:</hi> Mark, here's a ſad threatening; if thou remembreſt this, thou haſt cauſe to pity thy brother that hath done wrong unto thee, the Lord hath ſaid it, and thou haſt cauſe to pity him; <hi>Evil ſhall not depart from his houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The Lord may Object againſt thee, the Lord may ſay, I have been a friend to thee and done thee good all thy daies, and thou yet ſinneſt againſt me; and if this be not any bar unto the Lord to ſhew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs unto thee, let not it be a bar to ſhew thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs unto thy brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Ay, but he hath done me much wrong, ſpoken evil of me in every company he comes in: he hath wronged me after reconciliation and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, he hath done me much wrong: this is a hard task.</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:42593:89"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But let me ſay unto thee, notwithſtanding all this thou comeſt ſhort of the rule of Chriſt: thou haſt forgiven often, thou ſaiſt, haſt thou forgiven one Brother ſeven times? why truly there are many that cannot ſay they have exceeded that: But if thou haſt forgiven ſeven times, that is no great matter, thou thinkeſt it much, but Chriſt thinks it little: Alas! what is ſeven times to ſeventy times ſeven, four hundred threeſcore and two times? Which when done thou art but come up to the Letter of the Word! Thou haſt wronged the Lord in his Name, thou haſt ſinned againſt God again and again, thou haſt wronged him in his Name and in his Glory many thouſand times, and yet that is no obſtacle of the Lords mercy towards thee, notwithſtanding thine often renewed provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Oh let not the often renewed provocations of thy brother hinder thee from thy forgiving him.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>YOu have an Hiſtory in this Chapter of the ten firſt Patriarchs, from <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Noah:</hi> In every Age God had ſome to bear up his Name in the World; and amongſt thoſe, theſe ten Fathers were choice Pillars: But here is ſomething remarkably ſpoken of <hi>Enoch,</hi> here was accounted more of him than all the reſt: <hi>Enoch walked with God, and he was not.</hi> He ſaith of all the reſt, they lived ſo long, ſo many years, and then they died, but <hi>Enoch walked with God, and he was not;</hi> therefore we ſhould conſider who this <hi>Enoch</hi> was: the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament bears witneſs of him, and ſpeaks of this <hi>Enoch</hi> as one that was a choice piece in his Generation; the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> tells you that he was a Prophet, as you may read in that Epiſtle, the 14 Verſe, <hi>Enoch alſo the ſeventh from Adam, propheſieth of thee, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints to execute Judgement upon all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo <hi>Jude</hi> deſcribes him. Some
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42593:90"/> put a great deal in this myſterie; <hi>The ſeventh from Adam;</hi> and I think there was ſomething in it as he was a Type of Chriſt: he was a Type of that <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was to be the <hi>Reſt</hi> of his people, that was to give <hi>perpetual Reſt,</hi> everlaſting reſt unto his Sains: his name <hi>Enoch</hi> ſignifies one that was dedicated or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated unto the Lord; and ſo he was a Type of Chriſt that was choſen out among his Brethren, and he was ſeparated and dedicated unto the Lord, <hi>He walked with God;</hi> and ſo did Chriſt, and therein he was a Type of him: he was well pleaſing unto God, <hi>He had this Teſtimony,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, he pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the object of the Fathers good pleaſure in a ſpecial manner, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> But I rather think the Apoſtle intended no more than <hi>Enoch:</hi> but only to diſtinguiſh him from another <hi>Enoch</hi> that was in that Generation, as you may read of him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. And <hi>Cain knew his wife, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and bare Enoch; and he builded a City, and called the City after the Name of his ſon Enoch:</hi> So this <hi>Enoch,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. was a third from <hi>Adam,</hi> for he was not the ſon of <hi>Cain,</hi> but the ſon of <hi>Jared,</hi> and of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity by <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Rubin Cain;</hi> he came of that ſeed that was given inſtead of <hi>Abel;</hi> when <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlain, God gave another ſeed inſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> came of that ſeed.</p>
            <p>The Church of Chriſt ſhall loſe nothing by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if <hi>Abel</hi> be taken away by bloody hands, the Lord will raiſe up another ſeed; and <hi>Enoch</hi> a choice man is of that ſeed to hold up the name of God in the World. When <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was put in Priſon, Chriſt himſelf goes forth to Preach the Goſpel; the Church of Chriſt ſhall not loſe by Perſecution, out of the very aſhes of the Saints that are ſlain ſhall ariſe new ones, men upon
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42593:91"/> whom a double meaſure of the Spirit ſhall be given; as it was to <hi>Eliſha</hi> when <hi>Elias</hi> was taken away. And this by the way, Let us now more ſtrictly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what it is that is ſpoken of this <hi>Enoch:</hi> There are two remarkable things, the one is concerning his Life, and the other concerning his Death: Touching his Life it's ſaid that <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> he walked with God; nay, through his whole life he walked with God: ſo many years as he lived after he begat his firſt ſon, three hundred years and upwards, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he pleaſed God,</hi> that is his walking with God; in <hi>Heb. 11. 5. By Faith Enoch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death;</hi> before his tranſlation it's ſaid, <hi>He had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God;</hi> at the latter end of the Verſe, <hi>He walked with God:</hi> it was his conſtant aim to pleaſe God, in all things he aimed at God in the whole courſe of his life: <hi>He had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God;</hi> he lived in Faith and Obedience, and by Faith he pleaſed God, <hi>For without Faith,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>it's impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> He continually exerciſed Faith upon the promiſed Meſſiah that was to come, he lived in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation to ſee his day: and he ſaw it before-hand (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did by Faith) and rejoiced: and ſo he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, and by Faith he pleaſed God. And here is ſomething ſpoken of his death, or of his change: It's ſaid, that after he walked with God, <hi>He was not: He walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some conceive that all this is ſpoken of his walking with God: <hi>He walked with God, and he was not,</hi> he was not in himſelf, he walked in God and not in himſelf, he denied himſelf and followed God, he made a reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelf up to God, God took him up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but this is ſomething ſtrange! I rather think the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42593:91"/> latter part doth conſider the change of <hi>Enoch,</hi> his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of this life, <hi>He was not, for God took him;</hi> and we have good ground for this Interpretation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle gives it thus in that place before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. it's ſaid, <hi>By Faith Enoch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had tranſlated him:</hi> ſo <hi>he was not,</hi> that is, he was not of the World, he was not found any more amongſt men. He is ſaid to walk with God here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, after he had walked with God three hundred years, and <hi>he was not, for God took him.</hi> It implies a ſpecial way and manner of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s change, which was not ordinary: he died not as the reſt did, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was changed, as thoſe ſhall be, that ſhall be found alive when Chriſt ſhall come to be Judge of the World, they ſhall not die, but they ſhall be changed: ſo <hi>Enoch</hi> died not, but he was changed, his body did put on Incorruption, it did not ceaſe to be, but it was changed and tranſlated, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death.</hi> God took him up in ſome extraordinary way as he did <hi>Elias; Elias</hi> was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, he was taken up in the ſight of all his friends, Chariots and Horſes of Fire took him up, and carried him into Heaven, and ſo 'tis very likely, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up ſome ſuch way to Heaven: He was taken away from his friends, and they knew not what was become of him, God took him, they knew not where he was; <hi>He was not found,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, which doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that his friends ſought him, as the friends of <hi>Elias,</hi> they went to ſeek him when he was taken up to Heaven, ſo it's like he was ſought for, when he was taken up to heaven, but he was not found, God took him up; the manner of his tranſlation was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, even as that of <hi>Elias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enoch</hi> before the Law,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42593:92"/> and <hi>Elias</hi> under the Law, were taken up into heaven. But more of that hereafter. I ſhall only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make ſome entrance, and look upon this <hi>Enoch</hi> as a man that was a choice piece in his Age, in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: ſpecial notice is taken of him more than of all the reſt, <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may obſerve, That in all Ages God hath ſome of his Servants that are more eminent than others; God hath ſome in all Ages, that walk more cloſe with him, that are in a very remarkable manner holy, and gracious, and hold forth a great deal of God to the World; all the ten Patriarchs that were ſpoken of in the Text, they were gracious men, and they all walked with God: but it's ſaid of <hi>Enoch</hi> as if he was alone; <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> which doth intimate, that he walked with God in a remarkable manner, he walked more cloſe with God than all the reſt of his Brethren, than all the reſt of his Generation: <hi>Enoch walked with God;</hi> God hath ſome choice ſervants in all Ages: he loves all his Children dearly, as a father loves all his Children dearly, but ſome are nearer him than others, ſome are ſet upon the knee, and laid in the boſom when others ſtand by: choice affections are in the Lord to ſome, and made known to ſome. A Prince ſhall carry it reſpectively to all his Favorites, he'll ſhew favour to all: but yet ſome come nearer him than others, they know more of his mind, and are more intimate with him, they are taken into his privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, into his ſecret Galleries there to walk with him. And thus the Lord deals with ſome of his Saints: <hi>Enoch</hi> was a favorite in his Generation: Afterward comes <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> was a favorite in his Generation; ſee <hi>Gen. 6. 9. Theſe are the Generations of Noah: Noah was a juſt man, and perfect in his Generation, and Noah walked with God. Noah was a juſt man,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42593:92"/> and perfect in his Generation, Noah walked with God</hi> in a remarkable manner, he kept more cloſe to God than all the World beſide: <hi>But Noah found favour in the eyes of the Lord,</hi> it's ſaid, when all the World was drowned. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſuch a man in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he was a <hi>friend of God,</hi> God revealed more to him than to all the World beſides: <hi>I will hide nothing from Abraham,</hi> ſaies God in <hi>Gen. 18. 17, 18, 19. Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do,</hi> ſaies God, he'll teach his Children and Servants, I will not hide from <hi>Abraham;</hi> he was Gods choice favourite, and therefore he will not hide from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the thing that he will do. After <hi>Abraham</hi> comes <hi>Job,</hi> he was a favourite in his Generation: it was thought upon good ground, that he lived betwixt <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> when ever it was, he was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite in his Generation, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my Servant Job, that he is a perfect and upright man, one that fears God and eſchews evil, and there is none like him on the earth:</hi> Here is a high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is a man worthy to be conſidered, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſiders him, a perfect and upright man, one that walked up cloſe with God, as there was none nigher him in his Generation, there was none like <hi>Job,</hi> he was the choiceſt Scholar that God had in the World, and God taught him more than all the World beſides, he was the greateſt proficient in all the School of God, God gives him high commendations. And then comes <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is a favourite in his Generation, <hi>He ſaw God face to face:</hi> there was none like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> none had ſuch communion with God as <hi>Moſes</hi> had in his Generation, <hi>Come thou up into the Mount,</hi> he was Gods favourite, he walked with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, and there was none like him. And ſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> was gone, <hi>Joſhua</hi> in his Generation was one that <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42593:93"/> God fully,</hi> none but <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> followed God fully, they were the choice in their Generation. And ſo afterward <hi>David</hi> he was a man after Gods heart, a choice man in his Generation. And ſo <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and then <hi>Joſiah,</hi> of them both there was none like them in their Generation, there was none like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> in his Generation, and none like <hi>Joſiah</hi> in his Generation, they were choice favourites in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Our Lord Jeſus loved all his Diſciples dearly, and took care of them: but there was one of them lay in his boſom, there was one that was alwaies next him, and that was <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple; <hi>Joh. 21. 20, 21. Peter ſaw the Diſciple whom Chriſt loved, who leaned on his Breaſt at the Supper;</hi> he was nearer Chriſt than all the reſt; and ſo he inſtructed all the Diſciples, and revealed great myſteries to them all, but the greateſt of myſteries he revealed unto <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> in the Mount; and none ſaw Chriſts transfiguration but they three: they were choice Pillars in their Generation. As it is in the natural body, ſo it is in the body of Chriſt, there are ſome members that are nearer the head than others: all do partake of the ſame life, and of the ſame ſpirit, which runs through the whole body; Ay, but ſome are nearer the head than others, there's a greater dignity put upon ſome than others; ſome are more uſeful than others; ſome are of greater growth than others, and ſome have more ſtrength than others: So 'tis in the body of Chriſt; there are ſome of Chriſts members that he looks upon, and holds forth to the World as choice pieces, ſuch as <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job, Moſes, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb, David, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> were; all have not the ſame helps, and therefore all come not to the ſame growth, all have not the ſame means of knowledge, the ſame means of getting nearer God,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42593:93"/> and growing up in ſpiritual ſtrength and ſtature, there are ſome that are beloved of God that are but ſeldom rained upon, upon others ſhowers of Heaven do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill every day.</p>
            <p>Again, All have not the ſame Impediments, the ſame hindrances that ſome have, and therefore ſome out-ſtrip others. Grace in ſome of Gods people meets with an abundance of oppoſition, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of corruption; they meet with more temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than others, there's more blocks caſt in the way of ſome: the World is a great impediment, and proves a great ſnare to ſome, and they are kept back from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo nigh unto God as others. There are ſome that God doth inable to follow the Lamb where ever he goes; Oh, they get nigh God, they are choice men in their Generation, ſuch as are inabled to follow the Lamb where ever he goes. There are ſome that God makes very attentive unto his Word, their ſouls are continually bent towards God, and towards his Word, and they are liſtning continually to hear what God will ſpeak, and when God will ſpeak, they are nigher God than others; there are ſome that lay up the Word of God in their hearts, ponder the words of Chriſt, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, ſhe pondered the ſayings of Chriſt in her heart, and hid them in her heart, ſhe pondered them; why, theſe get nearer God than others. There are ſome that God makes wiſe to know their time, and to take their ſeaſon, to improve the opportunity that God puts into their hands, when God calls them to follow him, when the Lord breaths and ſtirs them up, then to ſtir up themſelves, and to take hold of his name; they are taught of God to know the opportunity and ſeaſon in which they may get nigheſt to God by following him. When God draws a ſoul after himſelf, when ſome cord of love is caſt about it, oh it breaths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42593:94"/> God in its ſpirit, when the ſpirit of God is breathing in their hearts; now thoſe whom God thus calls to improve their opportunity, and to do the work of the Lord with all their might, and with all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as Chriſt did when he was upon earth, theſe are the men and women, who get near God, of whom it may be ſaid as of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that they walked with God above all their Generation. And for the ground of this you muſt know,</p>
            <p>That God hath ſeveral works to put his people upon, he hath ſeveral works, ſeveral ſervices, and ſeveral ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and ſo accordingly he gives out ſtrength, and accordingly he draws into nigher communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There are ſome that God hath appointed for great ſervices in the world, ſuch as theſe had need be exceedingly ſtrengthened by ſweet communion with God, that their ſpirits may be upheld; and ſome God brings forth to great ſufferings, and therefore they had need have a great deal of ſtrength from God that they may be carried through. <hi>Job</hi> was a choice man, and God had great ſufferings for him, and there was none like him, nor no ſufferings like to his in his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Lord fitted him with abundance of grace to go through his ſufferings. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt before he was tempted had abundance of his Father, to his comfort there came a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> a voice from heaven doth evince and declare that he was the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The Lord Jeſus had great ſufferings, great conflicts, great temptations to grapple with, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father doth ſtrengthen him exceedingly: there were ſome that were ſet upon a hill, lights ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a hill can't be hid, the eyes of many are upon them, the endeavours of all the powers of darkneſs are to blow out ſuch lights, the name of God is greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42593:94"/> and greatly concerned in them, and therefore they had need have a great deal of clear light from Heaven, they had need be exceedingly comforted, and ſtrengthened in their ſpirits by the preſence of God, and by moſt near and intimate fellowſhip and communion with him; therefore the Lord diſpoſes that ſome of his ſervants ſhall be choice and excellent in their Generation, to be near to him as <hi>Enoch</hi> was who walked with God. Now therefore to apply things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> I beſeech you Brethren, That you would ſeek after this high meaſure of Grace and Holineſs, that you would labour to get nigh unto God, get as cloſe unto God as may be, that you may walk with God in an eminent manner in your Generation, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did: you have God himſelf for your pattern before you; Oh how the Saints ſhould ſtrive to be thus minded, <hi>Be ye perfect, for your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> you have God before you, you have Chriſt before you for your pattern. I do not ſay, be as holy and perfect as the reſt of your friends and neighbours, and meaſure your holineſs by theirs; but you ſhould ſtrive to go beyond all, beyond all creatures, look at none as your pattern but God and Chriſt: labour to get up to the height of eminency, the life of God in Chriſt; you can never get too nigh God, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have too much of him, there is no danger in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hard after God, there is certainty in the things of God. A man may have too much of the things of the world, there's danger in it, but a man cannot have too much of the knowledge of God, and of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; a man may have more, and too much of the World, as he cannot uſe it to the glory of God; Oh there is danger in the World in ſtriving to be the greateſt, to be the richeſt in the World, there
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42593:95"/> is great danger; but there is no danger in ſtriving to be eminent in grace, in ſtriving to get nearer to God, and to walk cloſe with God: this is the very glory of Heaven, it's worth the ſeeking after. My Brethren, preſs hard to get more nigh to God, to ſtick cloſe to God; it's the glory of heaven: heaven differs only in degrees from that which is given out to the Saints here; it's the ſame in eſſence; it's the glory of heaven to know God, to enjoy God, to walk with God, <hi>To follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes;</hi> it's the glory of heaven: and therefore I beſeech you, that you would now look upon it as your glory to follow God fully, as your glory to follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In the ſecond place, It may be a word of incouragement unto poor Chriſtians, weak Chriſtians, you that are ſenſible you are not the <hi>Enochs</hi> of your Generation: Oh the diſtance that is in your ſpirits (you ſee) betwixt God and you! Are you preſſing on after God, why then let me ſay to you, That you have the ſame for eſſence, that the beſt of the Saints have, though you have not the ſame in degree; I ſay, you that have the leaſt intereſt in Chriſt, you have the ſame for eſſence which the beſt Saints on earth have, and the ſame which the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heaven have, the difference is only in degrees, it's not in kind, and therefore preſs on hard that you may have more of it. It's not impoſſible that you ſhould come to the ſame height with them, becauſe the difference is only in degrees, it's not in kind. It's true, where there is nothing but gifts and parts, there the difference is in kind. If a man hath the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts in the world, he can never attain unto that which a Chriſtian hath; parts can never attain unto grace, but the leaſt meaſure of grace may grow up to the greateſt in time, for the difference is only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42593:95"/> 
               <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a grain of Muſtard ſeed:</hi> why, a grain of Muſtard ſeed when it's ſown, you know how little it is, but it grows up to a great height: where there is rooting in Chriſt, where there is a principle of grace in any ſoul, there ſhall be a growth, and that ſoul ſhall never leave grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till it grow higher and higher, as tall as heaven it ſelf, and there it hath its full growth and its full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But let me tell you that ſay, you ſhall never be eminent in your Generation; let me ſay thus to you, You have the ſame Mediator, that the chiefeſt of the Saints have, even you that are weakeſt; all they have, comes through his hand, and it's for his ſake: you have the ſame Mediator that they have, Oh why do you not improve this Mediator more, that more may be given out through him? If you were more in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and more in waiting upon him, ſeeing you have the ſame Mediator, you ſhall have the ſame wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com in heaven with the moſt choice of Saints: you have the ſame Fountain to go unto, and therefore do not ſay, you ſhall never be eminent in your Generation, you have the ſame fountain, <hi>All we from his fulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace for grace;</hi> the choiceſt have nothing but what they receive from Chriſt and his fulneſs, and the ſame fountain is as full for you as for them; nay, there is the ſame freedom of acceſs for you as for them, there's the ſame freeneſs in Chriſt to be given out to you; it's a fountain ſet open, ſet open for <hi>Judas</hi> and for <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> it's ſet open for the weakeſt, that they may come and drink and be cheared in their ſpirits; nay, let me tell you that the heart of Chriſt is more careful of you than of others, the heart of Chriſt is moſt careful of his weak ones. Oh, what proviſion doth he make for them? <hi>Simon Peter, doſt thou love me? why then keep my Lambs:</hi> if thou loveſt me, <hi>Peter,</hi> by all the love
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42593:96"/> thou beareſt to me, then take care of my weak ones, <hi>Feed my Lambs:</hi> and he takes care himſelf, great care; in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11, 12. it's ſaid there what Chriſt the good Shepherd ſhall do, that <hi>He ſhall gather the Lambs with his arms, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young:</hi> there is the ſpecial care that Chriſt takes of you that are weak.</p>
            <p>Nay, Further for your incouragement, let me tell you, that there is the ſame bleſſing upon you that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtrongeſt of thoſe Saints that God hath upon the earth: therefore there is way made for your growth and increaſe; when God makes the new creature, when ever he brings forth the new creature he bleſſes it: as when he created the World, he gave it his bleſſing, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply,</hi> and ſo to the Trees, <hi>Be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> and ſo where ever the new creature is, there is the ſpecial bleſſing of the Creator goes along with it: he ſaith to them all, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply,</hi> be fruitful in old age, and in <hi>Rev. 22. 11. Let him that is holy, be holy ſtill:</hi> there's a bleſſing upon every righteous holy man though never ſo weak, let him be holy ſtill, oh let him be more holy, let him increaſe in holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; there's the bleſſing of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, oh wait and look for this bleſſing, and know that the bleſſing of Chriſt is prevalent: the Curſe of Chriſt is heavy, it made the Figg-tree die to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry root, wither to the very roots: but the bleſſing of Chriſt can make roots that are withered to ſpring up and flouriſh.</p>
            <p>But again (to ſay no more) for your incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Conſider what promiſes the Lord hath made to the weak, to thoſe that are weak of ſtrength, which promiſes are in a ſpecial manner to be accompliſhed in the latter daies, as in <hi>Zach. 12. 8. In that day ſhall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42593:96"/> that is feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and the houſe of David ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them. Zachariah</hi> ſaith that there's a time a coming, that the weak and feeble ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> and they who are as <hi>David,</hi> ſhall be as the <hi>Angel of the Lord. David</hi> I told you was a choice man in his Generation, he was a man after Gods own heart, that walked with God moſt part of his life, he was ſtrong to do great things for God; now he that is weak ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> and he that is as <hi>David</hi> ſhall be made ſtrong as the Angel of the Lord. When you are in the midſt of the ſenſe of your weakneſs, look upon theſe promiſes, and deſire the Lord, that he would haſten the accompliſhment of them. Well, then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſuffer me to preſs this upon you, that you would labour to get as nigh God as poſſible you may, get as nigh God as may be; do not think it enough that you have an intereſt in Chriſt, that you have that which will carry you to heaven; Oh, let the ſpirit of a Child, of a ſon, this day be ſet upon you: ſeek not enough only to carry you to heaven, but ſeek more than ſo, ſeek that that will make you eminent unto God in your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that which will make you exceeding ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto God, and to your Generation in your Age, even this ſtrife ſhould there be to get into the very heart of God, Oh that God would reveal this to you, that you are one of his choice favourites. The nigher you are to Chriſt, the more you ſhall ſee of heaven, the more you ſhall know of his Mind, of his Will, and of his Word: you think that Diſciple was a happy man that leaned on Chriſts boſom, the Diſciple whom Chriſt loved, ſat next him, leaned on his breaſt; Oh how ſhould you preſs after this in ſpirit, to get as nigh Chriſt as may be, to lean on the boſom or breaſt of Chriſt as that beloved Diſciple did! I tell you, you that do ſo,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42593:97"/> you ſhall hear more from Chriſt than others do. Chriſt ſometimes ſpeaks ſoftly, and there's none hear what Chriſt ſpeaks but thoſe that ſit next him; the ſoul that ſits next him and cleaves cloſeſt unto him, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, hears many a word that other Chriſtians cannot hear: <hi>Enoch</hi> had choice things revealed unto him, God did reveal things to come unto him, becauſe he was the choice of God, and ſat cloſe to God. Oh, that you would labour after this, to get near unto God, there's many ſweet refreſhments that you may meet with, there's many a good bit that you ſhall get of him, which others of his Children don't taſte of, by reaſon they follow him not cloſe. Oh don't loſe the ſweetneſs of this! How ſweet is it to hear a word from Chriſt, and how refreſhing is that portion that Chriſt carves out. Strive in your Generation that you may be like <hi>Enoch,</hi> who in his Generation ſtuck cloſe to God, and walked with God.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Made entrance the laſt day, where I opened the words to you, we conſidered that commendation that was given to <hi>Enoch, He walked with God;</hi> ſo did the reſt of the ten Patriarchs ſpoken of, but notice is taken only of <hi>Enoch, Enoch walked with God,</hi> he walked with God in a ſpecial manner, he walked more cloſe with God than the reſt of the men in that Generation, and therefore it's ſpoken of him as if he alone had walked with God, <hi>And Enoch walked with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things I propounded to be diſcuſt, before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I come to the main general Propoſition:</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, That the Lord hath ſome ſpecial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that walk more cloſe with him in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than others. And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Lord takes ſpecial notice of ſuch; here is a ſpecial character upon them, ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honour that God puts upon ſuch. I ſpake of the former the laſt day; and we reflected upon it in way of Application.</p>
            <p>I deſire that all Gods people would labour to get as nigh God as may be: don't content your ſelves that you have intereſt in Chriſt, that you have that which will
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42593:98"/> carry you to heaven; it's a poor low ſpirit to take up here: but ſeek after that which may make you an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto God, and ſerviceable in your Generation, that you may walk with God in ſpecial, as ſometimes <hi>Enoch</hi> did. We ſpake alſo by way of incouragement unto thoſe that are weak, as if that you ſhould never get ſo nigh God, that you ſhould never be able to walk with God as <hi>Enoch.</hi> You have the ſame principle that have intereſt in Chriſt as the ſtrongeſt; though you be weak and never ſo weak, Chriſt is the ſame principle of life in you, and therefore you don't differ from them; you look upon Saints that are remarkable, and you are diſcouraged when you view the diſtance between you and them: but know, the difference is not in kind but degree; if the difference were in kind, there were no hopes of attaining to that meaſure, all the gifts and parts in the World can't grow up to grace; but where there is a principle of grace, though never ſo ſmall, though it be but as a grain of Muſtard ſeed, it ſhall grow, and never leave growing, till it grow as high as heaven. You have alſo the ſame Mediator (though weak) in whoſe name you may come and plead ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, as well as the ſtrongeſt; you have the ſame Fountain to go unto, infinite fulneſs that is ever running over, willing to communicate; there's the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of acceſs for you, this Fountain is ſet open for you as much as for the ſtrongeſt; it's the bleſſing of the new creature, <hi>Be ſtrong, let him that is holy, be holy ſtill, and him that is righteous, be righteous ſtill,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. The bleſſing is upon him that hath Chriſt and Righteouſneſs, let him be more righteous, and more holy, let him go from ſtrength to ſtrength, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he appear before God in <hi>Sion;</hi> this is the bleſſing upon him: therefore your weakneſs ſhould be no cauſe of diſcouragement. You have alſo the Promiſes, that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42593:98"/> the time ſhall come, <hi>That thoſe that be weak ſhall be as David</hi> (a Prophecie concerning the latter times) he that is weak ſhall be as <hi>David,</hi> and he that is as ſtrong as <hi>David</hi> ſhall be as the Angel of the Lord: So that you that are weak in your own apprehenſions ſhould be ſtrengthened, even as <hi>David,</hi> who was one that walked with God in a remarkable manner in his Generation. Therefore get as nigh God and Chriſt as may be: ſit at his Foot-ſtool; the nearer you are to Chriſt, the more you ſit under the dropping of his lips, the more ſweetneſs of Chriſt will fall into your ſpirits; the more his eye is over you, the better you are in his thoughts, and you ſhall have many a good bit, if you follow him cloſer than others. To proceed to the ſecond Propoſition,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That the Lord takes ſpecial notice of ſuch as do walk with him in a remarkable manner.</hi> The Lord takes ſpecial notice of ſuch, there is ſome ſpecial character of honour which the Lord will put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as walk with him ſo as <hi>Enoch</hi> did: it's written twice in this Chapter, that <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> God will have ſpecial notice taken of him; they all walked with God, the reſt of the Patriarchs, but notice is taken only of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s walking. The New Teſtament takes notice of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s walking with God: The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam,</hi> which I had occaſion to ſpeak of the laſt day. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> takes notice of <hi>Enoch,</hi> as one that liv'd by Faith, and by Faith was tranſlated; and before he was tranſlated he had this Teſtimony, <hi>That he pleaſed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall ſhew you how the Lord takes notice, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of ſuch of his Servants as do walk cloſely with him, in divers particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, The Lord bears witneſs to them, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42593:99"/> he bears witneſs of them in a ſpecial manner, I ſay the Lord bears witneſs to them, and bears witneſs of them. He bears witneſs <hi>to them;</hi> he ſpake evidently, clearly unto them; he clears up their evidences for heaven; he ſpeaks by his ſpirit unto theirs, and they are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the World; they bear witneſs to the name of God, and the truth of God, to the Word of the Lord, the Lives of ſuch of his Saints bear witneſs to the Word, they are a Comment, an Expoſition of the Word of the Lord, and therefore the Lord bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their ſpirits, they have ſpecial work to do for God in the World, and therefore God comes in with a ſpecial witneſs and teſtimony of his ſpirit with theirs, that he might ſtrengthen them, and carry them through all their undertakings which are for God. <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen veſſel, and was to bear up the name of God before the Gentiles, and therefore the Lord comes and ſpeaks unto his ſpirit in a ſpecial manner in ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of <hi>Paul, Paul fear not, I am with thee.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was to bear witneſs for God, to do great things for God, and therefore God bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Spirit in <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 18. he ſends him forth and tells him, <hi>He had made him a Brazen Wall, and an Iron Pillar,</hi> and he would carry him through all the work, and all his enemies ſhould not be able to harm him: they wait for the witneſs of God, for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit of God, their ſouls are alwaies hearkening, and they are liſtning what God ſhall ſpeak: they won't be put off with any other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony till God ſpeaks, their ſoul is not ſatisfied, God therefore comes in, and by his ſpirit witneſſes it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he writes their evidence fair, and writes it with the blood of his Son, and caſts it into their boſom, and they are careful to keep their evidence clear when God hath once given it out to them, they are careful to keep
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42593:99"/> it from blots and blurs, and to read over their evidences in Chriſt, and put it into their boſom: there's nothing they delight in, but in reading it again and again, and therefore the Lord doth witneſs unto ſuch. And he doth not only bear witneſs to them, but he bears witneſs <hi>of them;</hi> a high honour for God to bear witneſs of poor creatures: to bear witneſs of them, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my Servant Job?</hi> Job 1. 1. God gave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him, That <hi>Job is a perfect and upright man, one that feared God; he was one that eſchewed evil:</hi> God bears witneſs of him: and ſo in <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that he is a perfect and upright man, none like him in the earth?</hi> Mark, what a high Teſtimony God gives of him: <hi>Job</hi> durſt not ſay ſo of himſelf, he durſt not ſtand upon his own perfection, he durſt not ſay he was perfect, but God ſaid ſo: his friends would not ſay ſo of him, but they accuſed him, and ſaid he was an Hypocrite, becauſe they ſaw the hand of God went out remarkably againſt him; Ay, but God bears witneſs of him, whatſoever his friends ſay, God will convince them, that they judged with unrighteous judgement: therefore ſee what God ſaies to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Job 42. 7. My wrath is kindled againſt thee and againſt thy two friends: for you have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, like my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Job. Job was a perfect and upright man.</hi> Their walking with God is hid from the World, it's in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, their ſpirits are in ſecret carried after God, which are the choiceſt, and moſt curious waies of their walking with him in the World, they ſee not, and can't eye their walking with God, but God will take notice of what they have done for him in ſecret, and it ſhall be publiſhed upon the houſe top; God will bear witneſs of ſuch of his Servants
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42593:100"/> as walk cloſely with him in their Generation, he will bear witneſs of them before men; will bear witneſs of them either in their lives, or at their death, or elſe after death; in their lives, as he did of <hi>Job;</hi> at their deaths, he will give ſuch a teſtimony of them at death as ſhall make even their very enemies wiſh with <hi>Balaam, Oh that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my latter end may be like unto his;</hi> and then he will bear witneſs of them after death, when they are gone, I ſay, many Ages and Generations after they are dead and gone, God will bear witneſs of them, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where you have it recorded of all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, that by Faith they pleaſed God: and thus God will bear witneſs of ſuch of his ſervants as will cloſe with him in their Generation. And this is the firſt thing that God takes notice of in them, ſo as to bear witneſs of them, and to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But again, Secondly, God ſets up ſuch of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as <hi>Patterns</hi> to others for them to imitate: He ſets them up as patterns; this is a high honour to them for others to look unto: they are the very Images of God, they are the very Images of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſets them to be patterns to be imitated. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that walked with God, is made a pattern to all in his Generation; and <hi>Moſes</hi> a pattern of meekneſs, and <hi>Job</hi> a pattern of patience, <hi>You have heard of the patience of Job;</hi> and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>James 5. 7. And therefore be ye alſo patient unto the coming of our Lord. Be ye alſo patient; you have heard of the patience of Job:</hi> It's true, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the firſt and higheſt pattern, <hi>Be ye holy as your heavenly Father is holy, be ye perfect as he is perfect;</hi> there's a ſuitableneſs in the ſpirits and affections of the Saints in their deſires unto this pattern of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which is ſet before them; for as the perfection of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42593:100"/> God is infinite, as the holineſs of God is infinite, ſo there is a kind of infiniteneſs in their deſires and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in their purſuits after God; but when they look upon their actings and attainments, they ſee they come infinitely ſhort of God, and are apt to be diſcouraged, and therefore now the Lord hath ſet up other patterns for his weak Saints to look unto, and therefore they are ſuch as themſelves, to ſee how much they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in their Generation. <hi>You have heard of the patience of Job:</hi> and ſo in the ſame Chapter, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells them of <hi>Elias,</hi> a pattern which God hath ſet before them: he calls them to wait upon God by prayer; <hi>Elias,</hi> though a man ſubject to paſſion as we are, yet <hi>He prayed and it rained not,</hi> and <hi>he prayed again and it did rain:</hi> A man ſubject to the like paſſion as you are, and yet he prayed and it rained not, and he prayed, and it rained; therefore look you to be as patterns; this is another honour that God is pleaſed to put upon his ſervants, he makes them patterns to others. But again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Lord doth <hi>boaſt</hi> of ſuch of his ſervants as do thus: he <hi>boaſts and makes it his glory,</hi> he ſets them before, for all the world to look upon and behold his glory in them, in <hi>Rev. 14. 4. Theſe are they which follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes,</hi> let all the world look upon them, and behold the glory of God ſhining in them: theſe are they that follow the Lamb whereever he goes; you know what God ſaid to Satan concerning <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1. 8. and 2. 3. <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job?</hi> I have one ſervant that is worth the conſidering, ſaith God, <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſervant Job?</hi> Haſt thou ſet thine heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith he? Thou haſt been compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the earth, but haſt thou ſeen ſuch a one as my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Job?</hi> Thou haſt many ſlaves to boaſt on, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42593:101"/> many drudges, but I'le compare with thee above all: my ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> haſt thou conſidered him? he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and upright man, <hi>one that feareth God and eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth evil.</hi> And ſo <hi>David,</hi> God ſeems to glory in him, that he had ſuch a ſervant as <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Acts 13. 22. I have found David, the ſon of Jeſſe, a man after mine own heart, that ſhall execute all my Will:</hi> as good a ſervant as I deſire to have, he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all my Will, and he is according to mine own heart, he will do all my Will: God glories in it that he had ſuch a ſervant as <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, As God glories in ſuch, ſo he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> exceedingly in ſuch, as walk cloſely with him, they are the Object of his delight: it's ſaid in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 5. that <hi>the King is held in his Galleries:</hi> he ſees ſuch an excellent piece, he is held by his affections, and he cannot get out, <hi>Oh thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed mine heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck:</hi> Behold the beauty of thine eye, that eye of Faith, that eye of thine raviſhes my heart, it wounds the heart of Chriſt, it made him love-ſick, there was ſuch a dart from the eye that raviſh'd his heart, great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Lord takes in ſuch; Oh, ſaith the Father, here's the very Image of my ſon in ſuch and ſuch a Saint, here's the very likeneſs of my ſon, I can't but look upon this picture with delight, here's the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenance of my ſon, the very eye of my ſon, Doves eyes, the very caſt of his eye, and it's alwaies looking heaven-ward, the very caſt of the eye of thee my ſon: here's the very lip of my ſon that dropt ſweet ſmelling Myrrh; here is the very gate of my ſon, his very carriage, every foot-ſtep is like the foot-ſteps of my ſon, I can't but delight; the Father ſaw the Image of the ſon in ſuch, and the ſon ſees the Image of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42593:101"/> Father in ſuch, and therefore can't but rejoyce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them with exceeding great joy. That's a fourth. But again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, The Lord doth <hi>manifeſt much love</hi> unto ſuch: there's another ſpecial favour that ſuch as walk cloſe with God meet withal: Oh that all this which is ſpoken might refreſh your hearts. The Lord manifeſts ſpecial love and favour to ſuch; he communicates more of his love, they ſhall have the very heart of God, God unfolds, he'll unbowel himſelf unto them; the Lord can't contain it, he falls upon them, falls upon their neck and kiſſes them, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did upon his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns necks, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 14, 15. he could contain no longer, fell upon their necks, diſcovered himſelf unto them, I am your brother, ſaith he, <hi>I am Joſeph:</hi> there's abundance of love, precious love that the Lord doth reveal unto ſuch; he will ſatiate and ſatisfie their ſoul with kindneſs; there is a promiſe that is made in the <hi>Pſalms 36. 8. He will ſatisfie their ſouls with his loving kindneſs, they ſhall drink abundantly, and be ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe:</hi> they ſhall taſte abundance, not only ſo but be ſatisfied, taſte and be ſatisfied, with the goodneſs, and love of the Lord; there's none drinks ſo much, nor none meet with ſuch ſoul-ſatisfaction, as thoſe that walk cloſe with God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, The Lord <hi>reveals his ſecrets unto them,</hi> he'll with-hold nothing; <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham?</hi> The Lord will reveal it unto ſuch of his Servants, <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham?</hi> Gen. 18. 17, 18. <hi>ſeeing Abraham ſhall become a great Nation, and he will teach his Children:</hi> The Lord knows to whom he gives out, ſuch as will give out to others and be communicative to others, and therefore the Lord reveals himſelf unto them: they ſtand nigher God than others, therefore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42593:102"/> they ſee more than others, underſtand more than others, and ſtanding upon the hill top they ſee further than others: God reveals ſpecial things to them: <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam Propheſied of theſe, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, The Lord <hi>imployes ſuch upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Services:</hi> ſuch as walk more cloſely with him, ſhall do the great works of God in the world; great things are ſpoken of to come to paſs in the latter daies, and who ſhall be Gods Inſtruments to bring his great works to paſs? Why, the Lord will make wiſe ſuch as walk cloſely with him, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 14. The Army of the Lamb, ſuch as hee'll do great things by, they were ſuch as are <hi>called faithful and choſen;</hi> there's that commendation given of them, <hi>And they that are with him are called faithful and choſen:</hi> Theſe ſhall be his Inſtruments of the great work to bring down <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> by, to do his great work by, theſe ſhall be men of choice ſpirits, called, choſen and faithful, God will make uſe of them to bear up his name in the world, and he will uſe them as Inſtruments to bring to paſs the great things he hath ſpoken of: they are Inſtruments that will give all to God, and therefore God will make them Inſtruments of great work to him; and it's their ſtudy that the Lord alone may be exalted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord will make uſe of ſuch for ſpecial ſervice. But again in the eighth place,</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eighthly, The Lord takes ſpecial notice of them, for he <hi>puts ſuch a luſtre</hi> upon them as ſhall make them to ſhine in the eye of the world; this is another ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42593:102"/> that God is careful to put upon them, as that they ſhall ſhine in the eye of the world; that they ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reſpected or feared. Sometimes the Lord makes the very wicked in the world to reſpect them. <hi>John</hi> that was a burning and ſhining light, <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> how did God make even <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf to reſpect him? Even the wicked of the world are convinced by them, and God doth inforce the world to approve of them, to approve of the way they walk in, and to approve of their Integrity. There's a promiſe in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that God would make their very enemies to come and worſhip before them, and to acknowledge that God hath loved them; there is ſuch a luſtre upon them, upon their ſpirits, and lives, and carriages, when they walk cloſe with God, that the men of the world are forc'd to confeſs as of Chriſt, <hi>Never man ſpake as this man,</hi> and certainly theſe men are gracious men, what ever the world thinks of them, and oh that there were no worſe, and that I might die the righteous mans death, that my latter end may be as his; they are thus convinced by that luſtre that is upon them, or at leaſt, God makes the world to fear them; they are a dread unto the world: <hi>Abraham</hi> was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily feared by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> feared him, and ſent to make a Covenant with him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 22. he ſent his great Captain to make a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and why? Becauſe they perceived that God was with him, and God proſpered him, and therefore they are afraid that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be their enemy; though they were ſtrangers to God, yet the fear of his people, the fear of <hi>Abraham</hi> fell upon them: what a dread is many a godly man unto the wicked, their very converſations do convince them, the ſtirrings of God, the appearances of God in them do convince them: and therefore they cry out many times of them
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42593:103"/> as the Devils did of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth, Why art thou come to torment us:</hi> So a man that walks cloſe with God is even a torment upon them: the fear and dread of them fall upon their enemies; that's another ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that God puts upon thoſe that walk cloſely with him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninthly, Again, To ſuch as walk cloſely with God, there's an <hi>abundant entrance for them into the Kingdom of God,</hi> I ſay, ſuch ſhall meet with an abundance of entrance into the Kingdom of God; ſo ſaies the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. He bids them there <hi>Give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> be not idle, do not ſtand at a ſtay, preſs on, <hi>For ſo there ſhall be an entrance made, an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall be miniſtred unto you, into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> All Gods people do not meet with this abundant entrance, there are ſome that creep in at the narrow gate, ſome ſail to Heaven with quarter wind, others go with full ſails of Aſſurance. Now this ſeems to be promiſed to thoſe that walk moſt cloſely with God, that give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to wait upon God, and all diligence to increaſe in knowledge, and grace, full ſails of Aſſurance and an abundant entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto them into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. But again,</p>
            <p n="10">10 Tenthly, In the laſt place, Such as walk with God, God makes their <hi>memorial to be ſweet,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the juſt ſhall be ſweet when they are dead and gone, their names ſhall not rot, they ſhall be Embalmed, God will have them to be remembred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many Generations; <hi>Abel,</hi> though dead, he is yet remembred, God will take care that his Saints ſhall be remembred. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and though he was cut off, yet <hi>Enoch</hi> muſt be remembred, though
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42593:103"/> it were many hundred years before <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet God would have <hi>Moſes</hi> to write it twice, <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> Now God will have the very men in the world to honour their Names when they are dead and gone; the Prophets many of them were cut off by the wicked Jews, but God cauſed their names to be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when they were gone: and the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees (as wicked as they were) yet, notwithſtanding, they honoured the name of a Prophet; and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers killed the Prophets (though odious whilſt they lived, though cut off, as Chriſt himſelf was, and thought not worthy to live on the face of the Earth) yet their Names are precious and in memory: and thus you ſee that the Lord takes ſpecial notice of ſuch of his Servants as walk moſt cloſely with him; he knows that the Devil takes ſpecial notice of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he'll take notice of them; he knows that the world takes ſpecial notice of them to envy them, the ſpight of the world is againſt them, and therefore God will take them into ſpecial favour with himſelf: there are none ſo hated, none ſo maligned as thoſe that walk moſt cloſe with God; there is no ſuch eye-ſore to a carnal man, as one that walks cloſe with God: Oh, the light and glory of God that doth appear in ſuch a Saint doth convince the men of the world, and upbraids them, ſhames them, ſets their Conſciences on work, convinces them at what diſtance they are from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that the world hates them, there's none that meets with more ſpight from the world than they, and therefore the Lord takes ſpecial notice of ſuch, and there's none that the Devil ſtrikes more at, than thoſe that walk cloſeſt with God: for they are like a light ſet upon a Hill, and the Prince of the Air will endeavour to blow it out; they are as Beacons ſet upon a Hill, and the Devil knows that if he can throw them down, there
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42593:104"/> will fall many with them. <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my Servant Job?</hi> haſt thou ſet thy heart upon him? I doubt not but thou haſt conſidered him, thou haſt maligned him, ſought to caſt him down from his ſtation. <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan has a deſire to have you, that he may win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now you, but I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not;</hi> of all others, Satan deſires to have <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might winnow him. Such as are moſt eminent, the more eminent, the more doth Satan deſire to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now them, and therefore the Lord ſteps in, <hi>I have prayed for them;</hi> Chriſt ſteps in to plead for them in a ſpecial manner, he takes care of them: As the darts of the Devil are thrown principally at ſuch, ſo the Lord himſelf will be their Buckler, and their defence.</p>
            <p>Now Brethren, from all that hath been ſpoken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it; And oh that it may ſtir you up to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walk more cloſe with God; not only to walk with God, but to walk with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; it's not enough to be gracious, but what ſingular thing do you for God? I know that this will make you vile in the eyes of the world, but be you reſolute in the waies of God: It will be a blot to you in the eyes of the world, but it will be an honour to you in the eyes of God, who judges in truth and righteouſneſs; and therefore if the world ſpite you for this, for walking more cloſe with God, for embracing the truth of the times, ſay, If this be to be vile, I'le yet be more vile, and know that it ſhall not be labour loſt, I ſay, it ſhall not be labour loſt, to endeavour to walk thus cloſely with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, you ſhall meet with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment in God, which will abundantly anſwer what you ſhall loſe in the world, what you ſhall part withal in the world: the ſweetneſs that you ſhall meet withal in Communion with God, it ſhall abundantly ſatisfie for the loſs of all creature comforts whatſoever, if
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42593:104"/> you ſhall loſe any thing for walking thus cloſely with him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more, Your memories ſhall be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Gods ſight, when rich men, and great men, and men of parts ſhall rot and periſh, die, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and their names ſhall periſh with them and rot; Why, the names of the righteous, ſuch as walk cloſe with God in their Generation, their names ſhall be as a Box of Oyntment poured forth, and they ſhall be ſweet and precious to God and to his Saints through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Generations. And thus I have ſhewed you theſe two particulars, That God hath ſome of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in all Generations, that walk more cloſe with him than others; and ſecondly, That the Lord takes ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al notice of ſuch, and ſets ſome ſpecial badge of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon them; the main Point in hand is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>

               <q>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have already conſidered two Propoſitions that did ariſe from ſome particular conſideration, before I came to the main; Firſt, In that <hi>Enoch</hi> is taken notice of above the reſt; here are ten Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs ſpoken of in this Chapter, but it's ſaid of <hi>Enoch</hi> only, that he <hi>walked with God:</hi> they all walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, but he in a ſpecial manner. God hath ſome of his Servants in all Ages that walk more cloſe with him than others; that was the firſt Propoſition. And then Secondly, That the Lord takes ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch: here's more notice taken of <hi>Enoch</hi> than of all the reſt, <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> And there is one particular more before I come to the main Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</p>
            <p>And that is, The conſideration of the <hi>Time</hi> in which <hi>Enoch</hi> lived: It was in evil times; men began exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to degenerate, the world began to grow exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked, and was filled with violence, and therefore it was that <hi>Enoch</hi> did breath out threatnings againſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42593:105"/> them: he breathed out threatnings of Judgement againſt the men of his Generation, which the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> doth apply to the men of that Age in which he lived, in <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. it's ſaid there (ſpeaking of the wickedneſs of his Generation) <hi>And Enoch the ſeventh from Adam, Propheſied of theſe, ſaying, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him:</hi> the Prophet it's very probable did Propheſie this againſt the men of his Generation, they being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly corrupt; and the Apoſtle doth apply it unto the Age in which he lived, becauſe it was like unto the Age in which <hi>Enoch</hi> lived, which was very corrupt; ſo that you ſee (and it's very obſervable) that in the <hi>time</hi> in which <hi>Enoch</hi> lived, that Generation was very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, yet he walked with God. It affords us this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to pitch upon, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord takes it exceeding kindly, when his people walk cloſely with him in evil times,</hi> it's the great commendation of the Saints then to walk cloſely with God: it was the commendation of the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> in <hi>Rev. 2. 13. I know thy works, and where thou dwelleſt, even where Satans ſeat is, and thou holdeſt faſt my name, and haſt not denied my Faith, even in thoſe daies wherein Antipas my faithful Martyr was ſlain, who was ſlain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</hi> This was the great commendation of that Church, that though ſhe dwelt where Satans ſeat was, in the midſt of wicked men where the Devil rules, where the Devil hath his Throne, yet there thou haſt not denied my Faith, but there thou holdeſt faſt my truth: this Chriſt took exceeding kindly. It was the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42593:106"/> great commendation of <hi>Job,</hi> that he was a perfect man, he was a perfect and upright man, though he dwelt in the Land of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z;</hi> he was a man that dwelt in the Land of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z,</hi> a perfect and upright man, he was upright in the midſt of a ſinful people: they were of the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Eſau</hi> that inhabited that place, a crooked Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and yet <hi>Job</hi> was an upright man amongſt them; that was his great commendation. It was the great commendation of <hi>Noah</hi> that he was a juſt man in an unjuſt world; it's ſaid, the whole earth was filled with violence in <hi>Noah</hi>'s daies, and then <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt and perfect man. It was the great commendation of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he feared the Lord amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he dwelt amongſt thoſe that had not the fear of the Lord amongſt them, and yet he retained the fear of the Lord. And ſo it was the great commendation of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that his ſpirit was carried after God, not only when he was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but when he was among the Heathen, when he was amongſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhek,</hi> when he was in the Tents of <hi>Kedar, Woe is me, that I am to dwell with the Inhabitants of Meſhek,</hi> &amp;c. and yet even then <hi>David</hi>'s heart was carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and that was <hi>David</hi>'s great commendation. It was one of the glories and beauties of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That he was holy and righteous in a ſinful world, <hi>As the Apple-tree in the midſt of the Trees in the Foreſt, ſo is my Beloved among the Sons,</hi> Cant. 2. 3. He was an Apple-tree in the midſt of wild Trees, when he was compaſſed about with Bryars, Thorns and Thiſtles, and Crab-trees, yet he continued a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Apple-tree, and brought forth delightful fruit to God and man. Now for the clearing of this Point, That <hi>the Lord takes it exceeding kindly, when his people walk cloſe with him in evil times,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:42593:106"/>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you, Firſt, What the evil times are; And then Secondly, What it is to walk with God in evil times. And Thirdly, Make it evident, that this is exceeding acceptable unto God, which will make way for the Application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you enquire what thoſe evil times are in which cloſe walking with God is ſo exceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Times of <hi>General Apoſtaſie:</hi> times of great corruption, and of General Apoſtaſie from God, from the truth, and from the waies of God, and from the worſhip of God; when men ſhall loſe not only the power, but the very form of Godlineſs; when ſuch as ſeem to be like Stars, ſhall be ſwept down; and when moſt men are carried away with the ſtream of looſeneſs, it's an evil time, and then to walk with God is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious: Such was the time of <hi>Noah;</hi> in the time in which <hi>Noah</hi> lived the whole world was corrupt, and the whole earth was filled with violence; Ay, but then <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God in his Generation, and that was exceeding acceptable. And ſo again, we have other Inſtances of the like in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 12. It was the great commendation of <hi>Judah,</hi> that when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had corrupted themſelves, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had gone aſtray from God, from his worſhip, and from his truth, then <hi>Judah</hi> was found faithful with God, <hi>Ephraim has compaſſed me about with lies, and the houſe of Iſrael with deceit, but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints; Judah</hi> ſtill holds faſt, or <hi>Judah</hi> leaves a witneſs to his God, bears witneſs to the truth of God, and is faithful to the Saints, faithful to the Prophets, and that was the great commendation of <hi>Judah,</hi> to be faithful at that time; in a time of general corruption: And ſo again in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. It was a very evil, a very corrupt time, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42593:107"/> God took it exceeding kindly that his people did hold up for him: <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is in vain to ſerve the Lord, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord? and now we call the proud hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, yea they that work wickedneſs are ſet up, and they that tempt God are even delivered:</hi> but what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? mark the 16 Verſe, <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another,</hi> &amp;c. The people were wofully corrupt, God had a few names there that he kept faithful to himſelf, they that feared the Lord even then, when the time was ſo evil, they ſpake often one to another, and a Book of remembrance was written.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Times of ſore perſecution;</hi> times of perſecution are evil times, and then to walk with God is exceeding acceptable; ſuch was the time in which <hi>Elijah</hi> lived; it was a time of great perſecution, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi> had ſlain all the Lords Prophets, there was none in all the Land durſt appear for God, and therefore (he thought) he had been left alone, <hi>Lord they have ſlain thy Prophets, and left me alone:</hi> and yet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſtands up for God; there was none in all the Land durſt appear for God, and therefore <hi>Elijah</hi> thought he had been left alone, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 14. And yet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſtood up for God, and with an undaunted ſpirit bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtood up for God: this the Lord took exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindly at <hi>Elijah</hi>'s hand. What a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſtood it out in evil times, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the Word of my patience:</hi> Thou haſt kept my Word with patience, thou haſt kept my truth, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the oppoſition thou haſt met with, that truth which was moſt oppoſed, that truth which was moſt perſecuted, that which was the truth of the times thou haſt kept, and thou haſt kept it with patience, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42593:107"/> all thy ſuffering, notwithſtanding all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Therefore I will keep thee in the hour of temptation that is coming upon the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Times of <hi>Temptation</hi> are evil times, and then to walk cloſely with God is acceptable: when Satan himſelf, or by his Inſtruments ſhall endeavour to beat ſouls from their ſtanding, when he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to turn them aſide from God, then to hold faſt, is taken exceeding well. It is the great deſign of the Devil by himſelf, or wicked men, thus to ſtrike at Gods people; what do you get by your cloſe walking with God? Why, you get nothing but blows, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſtripes, and you are afflicted more than any; it was never worſe with you, than ſince you began to follow hard after God; this is Satans temptation, and now to hold faſt is very acceptable: thus it was with <hi>Job, Job</hi> 2. 9. the Devil tempted him by his wife, ſaies ſhe to him, <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine Integrity? Curſe God and die.</hi> Doſt thou ſtill retain thy Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; what, wilt thou ſtill walk with God? What haſt thou got by walking with him? Thou ſeeſt how ſad a condition thou art brought into, I would never follow that God any longer, I would curſe him and die: it's a ſore temptation, but <hi>Job</hi> ſtill ſtands in his Integrity, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſhall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and ſhall not we receive evil? Thou ſpeakeſt like one of the fooliſh women.</hi> But again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Times of <hi>Affliction</hi> are times of trial, and then it's moſt acceptable for Saints to walk with God: Times of Affliction, when God ſeems to frown, and God ſtretches his hand out againſt his own people, for them yet to purſue after God in their ſpirits, this is very acceptable; to run to God when God ſeems to ſmite them, to run into his arms, when they ſee he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42593:108"/> is angry, to run under his ſhadow, when God ſeems to beat them ſore; Why, this is very pleaſing unto God: Thus it was with <hi>Job,</hi> though God ſtretcht out his hand againſt him, yet he would not ſtretch out his hand to iniquity, but ſtill he kept his integrity: he was in a ſad condition, he was ſtript naked of all he had in the world, as you read in <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. and though God make him naked, he'll walk with God; though God lay him naked, deſtitute of all comforts, he bleſſes the name of God when all was taken from him, and it's ſaid, in all this <hi>Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> That's the fourth evil time, in which walking with God is acceptable. But I ſhall ſpeak moſt to the firſt of theſe, becauſe that concerns <hi>Enoch</hi> moſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Times of General corruption, times of declining, times of Apoſtaſie, then to walk with God is exceeding accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Then what is it to walk with God in corrupt times, or when do the ſervants of God walk with him in corrupt times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I Anſwer, Firſt of all, when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth of the times, thoſe truths that are moſt oppoſed, when they ſhall countenance thoſe truths that are moſt diſcountenanced, when they will not ſhut out the light, the truth that God holds forth in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, though the truth coſt them dear, though they muſt buy it, though they ſuffer the loſs of all for the truth, though it coſt them the loſs of their comforts, the loſs of their good names, the loſs of their Friends, the loſs of Eſtate, yet it's the truth of Chriſt, and it's the truth of the times: When God ſhall thus cauſe his ſervants to embrace thoſe ſcorned, perſecuted, and oppoſed truths of the times in which they live (as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age hath its ſpecial truth) wherein they are to walk with God in a corrupt Generation. But again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:42593:108"/>
            <p>2. Secondly, To walk with God in a corrupt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is to practiſe thoſe waies of holineſs, and righteouſneſs, and to ſhew forth thoſe graces which are moſt contrary to the wickedneſs of the times; this is walking with God in a corrupt time: I ſay, to practiſe thoſe waies of holineſs and righteouſneſs, and hold forth thoſe graces, which are contrary to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the times: and therefore it was <hi>Job</hi>'s great commendation, that he was upright, that he was an upright man in a crooked Generation, he lived amongſt a crooked people. And it was the great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Noah</hi> that he practiſed righteouſneſs; it's ſaid, he was a juſt man when the world was moſt unjuſt, it's ſaid, <hi>The earth was filled with violence;</hi> there was no righteouſneſs in <hi>Noah</hi>'s daies, and then <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man, he was a lover of juſtice and righteouſneſs, he was a follower of it, a pattern at that time when there was nothing but unjuſtneſs and violence in thoſe times: and thus to walk with God in a corrupt time is very pleaſing and acceptable. But again,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, To walk with God in a corrupt time, is then, when the Servants of God ſhall ſtir up others to cleave cloſe to God at that time: this is part of their ſervice at ſuch time to endeavour to ſtrengthen, and to hold up the hands and the hearts of one another, in declining and ſinful times; you may remember the place before, <hi>Mal. 3. 16. Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another;</hi> when the time was woefully corrupt, this was the ſervice of that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, they ſpake words of encouragement, to ſtrengthen one another, that they might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, that they might go on with boldneſs, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the name and truth of Jeſus Chriſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all oppoſition.</p>
            <pb n="212" facs="tcp:42593:109"/>
            <p>4. Again, Fourthly, When the Saints ſhall <hi>Reſt upon the promiſes of God, which ſeem to be far off,</hi> this is part of their walking with God in an evil time: I ſay, then to act faith in the promiſes, which ſeem to be far off; when you ſee nothing but corruption no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but darkneſs, yet even then to look to the promiſes of life, and holineſs, and grace, which ſhall be given out, and ſhall be fulfilled: when there is little or no knowledge of God, then to cloſe with the promiſe, that <hi>the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the waters cover the Sea;</hi> ſo the promiſe that God hath made to roul away the reproach of his ſervants, when they meet with nothing but reproaches from men, then to look upon the promiſe, that he'll roul away their reproach, and cauſe their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to break forth as the Sun at noon-day. That's another. Again,</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, When they ſhall <hi>Vindicate the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God,</hi> though never ſo ſeemingly croſs unto promiſes, and ſo clear all diſpenſations of God, both to the righteous and the wicked; and though he ſuffer the righteous to be trodden under-foot, yet they ſhall then vindicate God in his diſpenſations, and ſay, That the Lord is good and righteous, and juſt, and there's no iniquity in him; there's a time a coming when he ſhall clear up this truth, and they ſhall diſcern between the righteous and the wicked; there's a time a coming when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous;</hi> there's a reward for the juſt of the earth: they ſhall vindicate the Providences of God in the face of the wicked, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Saints to execute Judgement upon all;</hi> there's a day of reckoning coming when the wicked ſhall pay for all; this he reſolves on; and this is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of that ſervice, <hi>viz.</hi> what it is to walk with God in evil times, But,</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:42593:109"/>
            <p>3. Thirdly, It's exceeding pleaſing to God that his Servants (thus) ſhould walk and ſtick cloſe to him in evil times. I ſhall look no further than that of the Prophet <hi>Malachi, Mal.</hi> 4. 16. which we before ſpake of, <hi>Then they that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and then a Book of remembrance is ſet before them, for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name;</hi> You may ſee the Lord is exceeding intent upon his ſervants that walk cloſe with him in evil times, he doth eye them, and his ear is towards them, he liſtens to every word they ſpeak, <hi>They that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another;</hi> and it's ſaid there, <hi>The Lord hearkened and heard:</hi> the Lord hearkened: he did as if a man ſhould liſten to hear what his ſervants ſhould ſay one unto another; they had other liſtners it's like in that evil time, the wicked hearkened and liſtned, that they might trap them; Ay, but God liſtens for another end, he hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before them. There's another particular, which doth declare how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable it is to God that they walk before him in evil times, a book of remembrance is ſet before them while they ſpeak, God writes and takes notice of what they ſay, <hi>A book of remembrance,</hi> he writes a book of Chronicles that it may not be forgotten what they ſpake of God, and one to another: An alluſion to the cuſtom of Princes, that they had their books, in which they writ what any man did for them, what good ſervice they had done for the State; as <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s good ſervice was written in a Book, the King calls for the book in which the ſervices of <hi>Mordecai</hi> were writ: ſo the Lord looks in his Book; a Book of remembrance was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But again,</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:42593:110"/>
            <p>Further, <hi>A Book was written for them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name;</hi> nothing that they did for God, and ſpake of God, and thought of God, there's nothing ſhall be loſt: it was an evil time; and it may be they durſt not ſpeak all their thoughts; yet, all their good thoughts were taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the Lord, they were not let go, but ſet down in his book, even their thoughts were written down: God will write them that they ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Oh, <hi>I remember the kindneſs of thy youth,</hi> Jer. 2. 2. and <hi>the love of thy eſpouſal when thou followedſt me in the Wilderneſs:</hi> to follow God alone in a Wilderneſs, when there's little or no company, God takes this as a ſpecial reſpect and kindneſs.</p>
            <p>But why does God take notice of his people in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, who walk moſt cloſe with him in evil times?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, I Anſwer briefly, It diſcovers that the very <hi>Life of God and Chriſt</hi> is in that ſoul, God rejoices in the Image of his Life, which he beholds in his Children: it's an argument that the Fiſh hath life when it ſwimms againſt the ſtream; the dead Fiſh, that's carried down the ſtream, it cannot make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: It's an Argument the life of Chriſt is in that ſoul that is enabled to walk with God in evil times, to go againſt the ſtream of corruption and looſeneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, As it is an Argument of <hi>Life,</hi> ſo it's an Argument of <hi>Strength;</hi> that ſoul hath got much ſtrength from God, that walks thus with God in evil times: It requires much ſtrength to ſwimm againſt the ſtream, a great ſtream; there are times of great oppoſition; the ſervants of God meet with much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from Satan and the World, then, then to walk with God when all the world almoſt goes contrary, to bear up with God then, doth diſcover the ſtrength of the ſoul which God is exceedingly delighted with.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42593:110"/>3. Thirdly, Again, To walk with God in evil times, is an Argument of <hi>Sincerity:</hi> to do for God out of ſincerity; <hi>Job</hi> was ſincere, and ſtill retained his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that he met with; it doth diſcover that the ſoul hath a better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; that ſoul that bears up with God in evil times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath a better principle than the men of the world; that he doth not walk by the Examples and Commands of men: it's not multitudes of men; this carries on falſe hearts, which oft fall in evil times; and therefore when God (notwithſtanding general corruptions) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the hearts of Gods people to ſtick cloſe to him, it's an Argument of much ſincerity, and ſincerity is that which God is exceedingly delighted in.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall conclude with a word or two of Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Firſt of all, It lets us ſee how contrary the wicked are to the righteous: It's not a good time will make the wicked man good, as it's not wicked time that will make the righteous man evil; it's neither the time, place nor company that can change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wicked man: <hi>Saul</hi> retains his evil heart when he is in the midſt of the Prophets; though he be amongſt the Prophets, and Propheſie amongſt them, his heart is as evil as ever; but on the contrary, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> retains a ſweet enjoyment and breathings after God, when his ſoul was amongſt the Heathen in the Tents of <hi>Kedar;</hi> the wicked man <hi>will not learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in a Land of uprightneſs, let favour be ſhown to him:</hi> though he be in a Land of uprightneſs, he will not learn righteouſneſs; on the contrary, a gracious heart will not learn perverſeneſs, though he be in a Land of wickedneſs: For why? there's the ſeed of God in them, the ſeed of God ſhall preſerve them; and therefore, Oh what cauſe have wicked men to ſee
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42593:111"/> and bewail their condition! it's not time, place, nor company can make them better: in a Land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they'l be evil. Oh that the Lord would cauſe them to bewail their ſinful natures, and ſo come unto Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo he may make their crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtraight. And let the Saints be thankful unto God, for that principle of God that is in them, Oh what cauſe have you to rejoice in it, and to be thankful for it, that God hath put ſuch a ſeed of himſelf into you! that he hath made you partakers of his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, which all the corruption that is in the world cannot alter! All the ſalt water that is in the Sea can't make the live Fiſh ſalt, ſtill it retains its freſhneſs; and all the wickedneſs that is in wicked men, can't make the gracious heart wicked. I ſay, improve this that is of God in you, take heed that you be not carried down with the ſtream of corrupt times; but know the worſe that the times are, ſo much the better ſhould you (that are the people of God) be; you are ſet up as Lights in the night, you are as the ſtars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſo ſhall the righteous ſhine one day) and you (as the ſtars) ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine brighteſt in the darkeſt night; God hath ſet you up for this very end, that ſo you may be as witneſſes in the world, that you may bear up his name in the world, that you may witneſs againſt the general corruption of the times, in which you live: God doth therefore ſet you up as Pillars of Braſs, on which he hath ſet his name, and his ſons name, and you are to bear it in the world; he hath ſet you to bear up his name, and he hath ſet you to bear up the earth, if it were not for the few that did walk with God in corrupt times, the earth would fall; remember then that God hath ſet you up for this very end; therefore don't ſuffer the name of God to fall through your looſe walking with God, and through your giving way to the evil of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42593:111"/> the times; it's ſpecial ſervice God hath for you to do, you are ſet here for this very end to bear up his name, it's the work, the ſervice in your Generation; and therefore know that God calls for it at your hands, Oh know, he expects that you ſhould embrace the truth of the times that are moſt oppoſed, perſecuted and caſt out, that you ſhould practiſe the contrary graces unto the wickedneſs of the times, that you ſhould ſtrengthen and encourage one another in the way and work of the Lord, that you ſhould reſt upon the Promiſes, that ſeem to bear up and clear the Providences of God, againſt the blaſphemies of the wicked, this God expects from you in evil times: and know, that if you don't walk cloſely with God it goes to his very heart, I ſay (you that are his people) it grieves the very heart of God when you go aſtray from him; ſaies Chriſt of the twelve Diſciples in <hi>Joh. 6. 67. Will ye alſo go away from me?</hi> It's ſaid, that there were many at that time that left Chriſt; well, he turns unto his Diſciples, and ſaies to them, <hi>Will ye alſo go away from me?</hi> But <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaid, <hi>To whom ſhould we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal life;</hi> What, will you? if you ſhould go away, that would be a greater grief than all the reſt; you that have walked with me ſo long, what, will you turn aſide? It was the great commendation of <hi>Judah</hi> that ſhe was faithful with God, and he bids her ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; Oh let not <hi>Judah</hi> turn aſide, in <hi>Hoſ. 4. 15. Though Iſrael play the Harlot, yet let not Judah of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend:</hi> Though they play the Harlot, yet you that are my people, that have ſo long walked with me, and that have kept in my truth, Oh, have you a care, that you walk not with the multitude to do evil, and that you be not extravagant; it goes to the heart of God your Father, if you ſhould walk looſe and keep ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, this goes to the heart of God, it's more than if
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42593:112"/> twenty ſtrangers ſhould do it, if you in the leaſt ſhould turn aſide; this is a wound from a Child, and the wound of ſuch goes to the heart of the Father: But on the contrary, know that the Lord is exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with your cloſe walking with him; you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. how God is delighted with the cloſe walking of the Saints, it's kindneſs that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget, he will remember it to the laſt; in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 28. (to name no more) ſaies Chriſt, You are they that have continued with me in my temptations, <hi>Behold, I appoint unto you a Kingdom:</hi> this was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken: they did not only follow Chriſt, but they continued with him when under temptation, and when he was perſecuted, you that continued with me in my temptation and tribulation, <hi>I appoint to you a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The Lord ſaies of you, that are followers of him in evil times, that bear up againſt the ſtream, Theſe are they that have continued with me faithful, and I'le not forget them, thou haſt kept to me in the hour of my patience, and I'le keep thee in the hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that is coming upon the World.</p>

            <p>I Have already diſpatcht three Points, which were needful to be conſidered, before we come to the main; the laſt time, we conſidered what an evil time it was that <hi>Enoch</hi> lived in, the earth being ſo corrupt, as it appears (by that Prophecie of <hi>Jude</hi>) that the time of <hi>Enoch</hi> was an evil time: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the corruption of the time, <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> The Lord takes it exceeding kindly when his people walk cloſe with him in evil times. But I ſhall further Conſider what lies in the Text, <hi>Enoch walked with God.</hi> Here is nothing taken notice of but his <hi>walking with God;</hi> he was an excellent Prophet, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> doth witneſs, <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam Propheſied,</hi> he was one that did a great deal for God, he preached faithfully unto the men of his Generation: but there's nothing ſaid of him but this, <hi>He walked with God;</hi> he lived ſo long and he <hi>walked with God.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> Obſerve then, <hi>That it's the higheſt excellency of a Creature to walk with God:</hi> For this is the greateſt commendation that can be given of a man or woman, that they are ſuch as <hi>walk with God</hi> in their Generation. Here I ſhall ſhew you, Firſt, What it is to walk with God. And Secondly, That this is the excellency of any man or woman. And Thirdly, Wherein this excellency lies, which will make way for the Application.</p>
            <p>Our firſt work is to Conſider, <hi>What it is to walk with God;</hi> the way of a Chriſtians walking with God, is either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External; Internal</hi> is the way of his ſpirit, the way of his heart, which is hid from the world: <hi>External</hi> is the way of his Converſation. We ſhall now conſider the former only.</p>
            <p>What is this <hi>Internal</hi> way, the way of the ſpirit, the way of the heart in walking with God?</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Faith</hi> is the beginning of this way, I ſay, <hi>Faith in God and Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſes</hi> is the beginning of this way, for the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>We walk by Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> tells us expreſly, That <hi>Enoch walked with God by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 5, 6. it's ſaid, <hi>By Faith Enoch was tranſlated, and was not, yet before he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated he pleaſed God:</hi> where he holds forth to us, that <hi>Enoch</hi> lived and died in faith, and this was his firſt ſtep, and this is the beginning of a Chriſtians way in walking with God, he begins in Faith: 'Tis not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that two ſhould walk together unleſs they be agreed, ſo ſaies the Prophet <hi>Amos, Amos 3. 3. Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> It's not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible till Faith cloſe with Chriſt, there's no Agreement: it's faith that makes our reconciliation, and makes over this agreement to the ſoul, and therefore no walking with God before this agreement; it's not poſſible for
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42593:113"/> an Unbeliever to walk with God, Faith is the beginning of this way, for the ſoul is filled with ſlaviſh fear, and it dares not come to God, it dares not walk with him, it dares not come nigh him, till ſuch time as faith doth diſcover the grace, love and bowels of compaſſion that are in the heart of God; it runs away from God, the creature runs from God as <hi>Adam</hi> did, God walked in the Garden, and he called for <hi>Adam</hi> to walk with him, but he durſt not, the guilt of his tranſgreſſion was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he hid himſelf among the Buſhes in the Garden; Poor creatures! they run not only into the buſhes of the Garden, but into the buſhes of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, they would hide themſelves in the Thickets of their own righteouſneſs, in Bryars and Thorns, rather than come in and ſubmit to God again: There's not only pride of heart, but there's enmity, enmity againſt God, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God;</hi> he wiſhes there were no God, that he might ſtill be without controul, and give no account of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there's enmity in the heart, and this ſlaviſh fear and enmity remains till ſuch time as God diſcovers it, and roots it out by faith, and faith diſcovers the tender bowels, love, and compaſſions that are in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it through Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that as the ſoul goes on in believing, ſo it goes on in walking with God: A Chriſtians Exerciſe of faith is the acting of faith, and exerciſing of faith every day on the promiſes, is a great part of his daily walking with God, for he that walks with God acts faith, in all conditions he runs to the Promiſe; when the guilt of ſin revives, he runs to the Fountain ſet open for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to waſh in, and he rouls upon the Promiſe, <hi>Lord, thou haſt promiſed to blot out my tranſgreſſions like a thick Cloud;</hi> and ſo when he wants holineſs, when corruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails he runs to the promiſe, Lord, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>ſin
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42593:114"/> ſhall not have Dominion over me;</hi> thou haſt ſaid, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, dead to ſin;</hi> and ſo in time of temptation he runs to the Promiſe, Lord thou haſt ſaid that ſuch of thy ſervants as walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light, ſhould truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon their God; and thou haſt ſaid, No temptation ſhall be a burden beyond their ſtrength: And ſo in all ſtreights and afflictions, it runs to the Promiſe, Lord thou haſt ſaid, That all things ſhall work together for good to them who love and fear thee. In a word, This is to walk with God, when the ſoul ſhall reſt upon the Promiſe for all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies both for this life, and that which is to come; when he ſhall truſt the Lord for proviſion in the way, and truſt him for an Inheritance in the end of the way, he ſhall ſay, Lord, thou haſt given me the Word of thy grace, and I'le venture my ſoul upon it, though it be for eternity I'le venture upon thy Word, if I periſh I periſh; if God can deceive me, I am willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Thus doth faith put the ſoul into a capacity and poſture of walking with God, it puts the ſoul in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of walking hand in hand with God, as a man with his friend, it puts the ſoul into the beſt poſture of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and that is, into a poſture of leaning and ſtaying upon him as it walks with him. It's ſaid that the Spouſe, as ſhe came out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>She came leaning upon her Beloved;</hi> The Lord knows, his poor ſervants are not able to walk with him in the Wilderneſs, unleſs they lean upon him, and they can't ſet one ſtep forward unleſs they lean upon him, and therefore he hath given them himſelf, his ſon, and his ſons name, his Word, to ſtay and lean upon in the Wilderneſs; and this is the beginning of all their walking with God. That's the firſt particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:42593:114"/>2. Secondly, To walk with God is to <hi>Bow the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto God;</hi> this is another part of the Internal walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; I ſay, when the ſpirit bows unto God, when the powers of the ſoul are over-powered by the Spirit of Chriſt to ſubmit unto him, for the very powers of the ſoul are reſigned up to Chriſt; when the ſoul gives him the chief place in the heart, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that God may be ſet up in the very excellencies of the ſpirit; it can't be content unleſs God have that ſtrong hold, unleſs he gain the inward-moſt Tower and Caſtle, the very heart and ſpirit which he deſires may bow to God; when it is not content to give him the ſervice of the outward man, but deſires to ſerve him in ſpirit alſo, and therefore does cry out of thoſe inward luſts that defile the ſoul, and do hinder it from acting towards God: though others, though ſtanders by look upon ſuch a ſoul, and ſee that God hath done a great deal for it, yet he can't be ſatisfied ſo long as there are any riſings in the inward man, any rebellious luſts in the heart that do riſe up againſt God, it deſires that the Word of the Lord may bring down every Towery imagination, and that it might lead every thought into Captivity unto Jeſus Chriſt: when the ſoul makes it his work, thus to bow the ſpirit, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man unto Chriſt, to ſerve him in ſpirit, to give him the choice, the excellency of the affections, and the higheſt place in the ſoul, and is never quiet till eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baſe luſt be caſt out of that inward Caſtle and Tower; this is another part of that Internal walking with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, when the ſoul is <hi>carried out with ſtrong deſires after the enjoyment of the preſence of God;</hi> when the ſoul delights in the preſence of God, and is carried out with ſtrong deſires after further and further injoyment of God, this is a part of the ſouls walking
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42593:115"/> with him; when it can't take up in any thing ſhort of God; Creatures and Ordinances can't ſatisfie, if it don't meet with God in them, and therefore it deſires to uſe all creatures for that end that he may ſee God in them, and glorifie God for them, and be led unto God by them, that ſtill he may come nearer unto God, whom to enjoy is his happineſs; and ſo for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, he uſes them all for that end that he may get nigher God, and enjoy more of the preſence of God, and therefore he will wait upon the diſpenſation of the Word, becauſe God hath promiſed to be there, and therefore he will walk with the Saints of God, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed to walk in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks, for there he expects to meet him, and deſires to enjoy much of God and Chriſt; I ſay, when the ſoul thus enjoies much of God, it's a great part of its walking with him; and therefore when God ſtands at a diſtance and hides his face, it goes up and down la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting; Oh, this is the greateſt perplexity in the world, for God to turn away and hide his face, and to lead him into a poor dark condition, Oh, Lord turn again, ſaies he, let me ſee thy face; though he chide him, better than not to ſee his face or hear his voice at all; and therefore its deſires are vehement when God ſeems to exempt himſelf. Therefore <hi>David</hi> breaths after God, in <hi>Pſal. 42. 1, 2. As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God. My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> As the Hart breaths after the water brooks; Oh, it is a mighty deſire that the poor, chaſed, hunted, bleeding Hart has after the water brooks, and ſuch is <hi>Davids</hi> deſire after God, <hi>Oh when ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God?</hi> It's alſo expreſt in <hi>Iſa. 26. 9. My ſoul ſought after God in the night ſeaſon</hi> (ſaies the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42593:115"/> Church there) <hi>with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early;</hi> it's a very Emphatical expreſſion, <hi>with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> Well, this is another part, a third ſtep of the ſouls walking with God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Again, <hi>When the ſoul is filled with mighty deſires of being made like unto God;</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are continually extended this way, in being made like unto God; it looks upon it as his glory, as his happineſs: It's the greateſt part of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be made like unto God, and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cries out ſo much of the old man, and of the body of ſin and death, and deſires ſo much to be ſatisfied and filled with the likeneſs of God; he looks upon Chriſt for this end, and beholds the glory of God in Chriſt, and he looks wiſtly, and would alwaies be looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, that ſo he might be changed from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord. His deſires are mightily carried out, in being made like unto Chriſt, and he looks upon the promiſes for this end, that they may purge, ſanctifie and cleanſe from all pollution both of fleſh and ſpirit; the ſpirit of God ſhining in them and through them, it might convey more of the divine nature to them: That's another part of his walking with God. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, <hi>When the ſoul is deſirous to embrace all the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> I ſay, it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to embrace all the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt, and to walk up to them, and to improve them. Oh that ſentence is writ upon the ſoul, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſpeaks;</hi> and therefore the ſoul is attentive, and is intent upon God for this very end, That he may know the mind of God, and not loſe its opportunity, that it may hear when the Spirit calls, and ſaies, <hi>Come away:</hi> There's
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42593:116"/> a great deal in this; this is that which conduces unto a Chriſtians peace exceeding much: the knowing and improving ſuch opportunities of Chriſts ſpeaking in his heart, conduces to his peace and growth, and to his uſefulneſs and ſerviceableneſs in thoſe ſeaſons and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; when the Spirit of Chriſt (as I may ſay with holy reverence) whiſpers in the ſoul, when the Spirit of Chriſt ſaies, Here's an opportunity of doing good to the ſoul, or to the body of a poor creature; Oh, how is then the heart drawn out amain to lay out himſelf for God, his ſtrength for God, and to lay forth his Eſtate for God? And he ſaies as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Loe I come:</hi> Here's an opportunity for ſervice; why, then, <hi>Loe I come to do thy Will, O God;</hi> the embracing, I ſay, and cheriſhing thoſe motions of the Spirit of God, which he is pleaſed to hint in the ſouls of his people, is another part of their walking with him. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, In the next place, That ſoul walks with God <hi>when it ſets it ſelf in the eye of God;</hi> when it eyes God continually, and ſets it ſelf in the eye of God, in the preſence of God, this is a main part of his walking with God; when a man ſhall do all that he doth as in the preſence of God, every action, that though it concerns man and his outward calling, yet he deſires to do all as in the preſence of God: And therefore he doth not only look to a duty, but he looks to the manner of the performance of every duty, becauſe the holy, pure and piercing eye of God is upon him; he looks to the manner, how it's carried on and forth, what ſpirit is in it, becauſe he knows that the eye of God is piercing, it's a flame of fire, and he doth all as in the preſence of God, and unto God, in his ſerving of man, he doth it as unto the Lord: he hath a higher end than the men in the world have, who know no
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42593:116"/> other end than to gain riches and honour, or the like; but there's a further and higher end, that he may lift up the name of God, and ſerve God in ſerving of man, that he may ſerve his Generation according to the Will of God; I ſay, when the ſoul is thus alwaies under the eye of God, and therefore is faithful whether man ſee or no, though there is no eye to witneſs, no eye to over-look, yet it knows that it's in the preſence of God, for though he don't ſo ſee the tranſgreſſion of his people as to caſt them off, yet he may ſee that which may be matter of ſore diſpleaſure and grief; and therefore this is that which is as a bridle and a bit over all his waies, that it is in the preſence of God. Again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, In the next place, The ſoul walks with God <hi>when he is deſirous to embrace every truth that God ſhall impart;</hi> when it opens to truth; this is another part of the ſouls internal walking with God: when it opens to truth, to every truth which the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing and profeſſing of may coſt him dear, being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the world; it matters not, if you be perſwaded it's the truth of Chriſt it's enough, it truſts God for the reſt; oh it's greedy after truth; that ſoul that walks with God, oh how fearful is it, leſt it ſhould not embrace truth? Oh how fearful is it leſt it ſhould be left behind when God advances his truth in the world; and when truth is advanced, Oh, how fearful is it to be left behind? Though it would not ſet a ſtep, until God goes before, and it would not hear the voice of a ſtranger, yet it would not be ſhut up from the voice of Chriſt, therefore it's fear is to be left behind, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that God would take it along: when he diſcovers truths unto a Saint, even the truth of the age, and the truth of the Generation in which he lives; that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the ſouls walking with God. Again,</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42593:117"/>8. In the Eighth place, The Soul walks with God <hi>when it can juſtifie the Word of God;</hi> juſtifie the Word of God, though the Word condemn him in his practices, yet he will juſtifie the Word of God; though the Word be high, holy, and ſpiritual, and he ſees he is a poor creature and can't come up to it, yet he won't deſpiſe nor hate the Word, but loves, juſtifies and bleſſes God for it; ſo the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom. 7. 12. Wherefore the Law is holy,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and the Commandment is holy, juſt and good.</hi> Again in the 13 Verſe, <hi>Was then that which was good made death to me? God forbid. But ſin that it might appear ſin, working death in me by that which is good: that ſin by the Commandment might become exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful.</hi> And again in the 16 Verſe, <hi>If then I do that which I would not, I conſent unto the Law that it is good.</hi> Though I do the things that I would not, yet, ſaies he, I love the Law and delight in it in the inward man; this is a main part of the ſpirits and ſouls walking with God, when it can thus juſtifie and clear the Word; and though the Word of the Lord croſs him, yet it gets to the Word of the Lord, and though he can't come up to it, yet it bleſſes the Word, that's holy and good, though I be carnal, though I be ſold under ſin, it juſtifies the Word.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Again, In the Ninth place, <hi>He will Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie God;</hi> that's another part of his walking, he will juſtifie God, and clear God in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, though God go againſt his comforts, and ſmite them as he did <hi>Job,</hi> yet ſtill he'll walk and go along with God, and clear and juſtifie God: <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly, the Lord gives, and the Lord takes, and bleſſed be his name.</hi> Still he will juſtifie God though he can't ſee a reaſon of Gods proceedings, yet ſtill he will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42593:117"/> God; though he do him wrong, yet God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteous, and merciful; and this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the ſouls internal walking with God. Again,</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the Tenth and laſt place, to name no more, The ſoul then walks with God, <hi>When it is taken up with higher things than the things of this World.</hi> It deſires to look up to higher things than the things of the world, and greater things than the world is able to preſent, and therefore would not have the world for its portion at no rate, he can't take up there, no, he hath higher things to fix his heart upon: the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſpend their time and meditations upon their Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, upon their Houſes and Land, but a gracious heart will not ſpend many of his thoughts upon theſe, it will not ſpend the beſt of his thoughts upon theſe, but ſaies to his ſoul as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Mother ſaid to him, <hi>Prov. 31. 2. Oh my ſon give not thy ſtrength to women,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ſaies he, Oh my ſoul give not thy ſtrength to the things of this world, give not the ſtrength of thy heart and affections, to theſe poor low things, thou haſt better things to ſpend thy ſtrength upon, there's God and Chriſt, there's a Kingdom, there's the Pearl of great price, there's an Inheritance, there's an Eternity, there's an everlaſting enjoyment of God, theſe things art thou to be taken up with; theſe things doth he deſire to ſpend the beſt of his ſtrength and thoughts upon. You ſee my Brethren in part, what it is to walk with God, this is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, the way of the ſpirit, the way of the heart in walking with God; this the Lord will have laid before you as your duty, and although you ſee you come infinitely ſhort of it (as all Chriſtians may ſee how they come ſhort of it) yet the Lord will have this truth diſcovered, and this way laid before us, though we come
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42593:118"/> infinitely ſhort, and turn aſide in our walkings with God, yet be juſtifying of him, and vindicating of his Word, and ſay, Bleſſed be thy name and the word of thy grace which thou haſt made known unto us, and ſee that ye walk humbly wherein you come ſhort, and get out of your ſelves more unto Chriſt, that he may give you ſtrength to walk with him. So much for this time.</p>

            <p>I Have handled divers Propoſitions, we are now come to the main, <hi>It's the greateſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be given to a man or woman, that they are ſuch as walk with God in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi> it is the excellency of the creature upon earth to walk with God. I ſhall come to the Second Part,</p>
            <p>And that is, the Chriſtians <hi>External</hi> walking with God. To ſhew what is this external walking with God; It is either in its general or particular calling. Or he walks with God,</p>
            <p>Firſt, In thoſe things that do more nearly concern <hi>God himſelf.</hi> And Secondly, He walks with God in the waies of his <hi>Calling and Employment in the World.</hi> And Thirdly, He walks with God in the <hi>ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that God hath placed him in.</hi> To ſpeak to the firſt of theſe: And a Chriſtian then walks with God,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:42593:119"/>1. Firſt of all, When he walks by rule; this is the firſt ſtep of his acceptable walking with God, I ſay, when he walks by rule: he knows that his heart is ready to go aſide, to decline from truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore he continually looks back for a rule to walk by, leſt he turn aſide; he knows that he is a creature, and his dependance is on God, and that the creature muſt walk by rule that the Creator gives forth, he knows that whatſoever is without rule, is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the Lord, though it may ſeem never ſo good, never ſo ſpecious to the eye, yet if there be not a rule for it, it's an abomination unto the Lord, and God ſaies, <hi>Who hath required this at your hand,</hi> as in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 14. For <hi>Iſrael hath forgotten his maker, and builded Temples, and Judah hath multiplied fenced Cities, but I will ſend a Fire upon his Cities, and it ſhall devour the places thereof:</hi> One would have thought this had been no forgetting of God, to <hi>build Temples unto God,</hi> and yet ſee how the ſpirit of God doth Interpret it, <hi>Iſrael hath built Temples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath forgotten his maker;</hi> they did it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God, but God bid him not do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no rule, no command from God; nay, God commands that there ſhould be but one Temple, and for them to multiply Temples for their own devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this was beſides Gods rule, and therefore God did not approve of it. Now he that walks with God walks by rule, and he that walks by rule hath this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule as that which is revealed in his Word, as the Sun when it ſhines upon the Dial, it directs a rule for you to walk by. There are corrupt rules; in times paſt ye walked according to the common courſe of the world; they walked by rule, but it was a wicked rule, not of Gods making; they walked according to the common courſe of the world; ſome men walk by the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42593:119"/> Example of others, they make that their rule, the example of the multitude, great men, and ſuch as are counted wiſe, learned, judicious and prudent men, and the like, but this is a walking according to the courſe of the world; ſome make their own wills and luſts their rule, whatſoever ſeems good in their own eyes, a rule to walk by: but he that walks with God, walks by no other rule than the rule of the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtands in the way and enquires: he enquires for the way, as God commanded the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 6. 16. ſaying, <hi>Stand ye in the waies and ſee, and ask for the old Paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls:</hi> he bids them ſtand in the way, and enquire for the good old way, and he enquired at the mouth of God. So did <hi>David:</hi> in all his Enterpriſes he takes God along with him, in 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 1. Shall I go up and fight againſt this people?</hi> Shall I go up? he enquires of the Lord, his recourſe is to God continually; Shall I go up or not? Lord ſhall I take ſuch a courſe? Shall I take upon me ſuch an Imployment? Shall I enter into ſuch a relation? What is the mind of God? ſhall I go? or ſhall I not go up? And when the Will of God is cleared up to him, he reſts ſatisfied, he cares for no more; he knows it's good to take God along with him, he would not go without God, nor take any thing in hand without God, and therefore he continually looks up to him for grace: That's the firſt part, or firſt ſtep, he walks by rule. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, No oppoſition, no difficulty in his way, no ſad event can turn him aſide from doing his duty; this is another part of the Character of him that walks with God; I ſay, when his duty is revealed to him, and made known by the Word, there's no difficulty, no diſcouragement can turn him aſide, or cauſe him to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42593:120"/> deſiſt from that which is his duty: though he meet with diſcouragements from within and from without, even his own bowels riſe up againſt him, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are within him do oppoſe the work of the Lord in the performance of his duty; his unbelieving heart tells him, he had as good deſiſt and give over, he ſhall never prevail nor do good on't, nor be a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the way of God; notwithſtanding his diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, he looks upon the ſtrength of Chriſt and goes on. Sometimes the Devil ſets upon him, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth back corruption, and he meets with many a ſtorm to blow him back again from following after God: but he looks to the promiſe and goes on, <hi>The God of Peace ſhall tread down Satan ſhortly;</hi> he looks to Jeſus who was tempted, and is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, and therefore ſtill he goes on. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he meets with diſcouragements from the world, there are reproaches caſt in the way, ſlanders caſt in the way, Perſecutions many times lie in the way; Ay, but ſtill he goes on, and remembers that the Lord Jeſus himſelf went through this way, and remembers that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt walk through this way, believes that there is a time when God will roul away all the reproaches of his ſervants, and therefore notwithſtanding all oppoſition, goes on, not looking to the event; ſuch a duty may coſt him his liberty and life, but he looks whether it be his duty, and conſiders not the event, he will truſt God for it: So did the three Children in <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. when the King threatens to caſt them into the Fiery Furnace, the 15, 16, 17 Verſes, ſay they, <hi>Oh King we are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to anſwer thee in this matter, our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us; however we will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thine Image:</hi> he looks, I ſay, to his duty, that walks with God, and truſts him for the event; nay,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42593:120"/> though friends be againſt him, which is very ſad, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their perſwaſions, ſometimes by their frowns and threatnings, it's a great temptation; Ay, but ſtill he goes on: So did <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. you ſhall ſee there when they would have diſſwaded him from his duty, becauſe of danger that was in his way; <hi>Why,</hi> (ſaies he there) <hi>why, what do you mean to weep, and to break my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem, for the name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> What do you mean, to weep and break my heart? there's no ſad event can diſcourage me from that which is revealed to me to be my duty; nay, God himſelf when he ſeems to break him, and to turn againſt him, to ſmite him in his body and eſtate and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though the hand of the Lord ſeems to be gone out againſt him, yet he will not deſiſt from walking with God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17. ſee what they ſay there, <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have not we forſaken thee, nor dealt falſely in thy Covenant;</hi> and therefore he follows God in the Wilderneſs, when he is left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all creature comforts; ſo did <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Jer. 2. 2. I remember the kindneſs of thy youth, when thou didſt follow me in the Wilderneſs, in a Land that was not ſown; David</hi> was ſtill carried after God, though he was in a Land where no water is, <hi>My ſoul breaths after thee, O Lord, in a dry and thirſty Land where no water is;</hi> when God and the creature ſtand in competition, he falls on Gods ſide, and when he and the creature muſt part, he chooſes to follow God, though he follows him naked, though naked of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, yea, and God ſhall not have the leſs of him though he takes away all his comforts: he ſhall not have the leſs love, nor the leſs ſervice, nor the leſs praiſe, though God ſtrips him naked of all, this ſhall be no diſcouragement; and thus it was with <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42593:121"/> the latter end, when all was taken from him he bleſſes the name of the Lord, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord; in all this Job ſinned not.</hi> This is another part of his walking with God, there is no oppoſition, no diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement that he meets withal, can turn him back to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his duty. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, He that walks with God labours to do ſome ſingular thing for God, his deſire is to hold forth much of him, much of God in his converſation, to do ſome ſingular thing for God: he knows that he hath ſet him in the world for this end, To bear up the name and honour of God in the world; that God hath poured his Spirit upon him for this end, that ſo in the light of God he might ſhine, and ſhine gloriouſly in a dark world, and therefore he deſires to do ſomething ſingular for God, becauſe he hath done ſingular things for him; as thus, his deſires, his endeavours are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the cauſe of God in the world, to help forward the ſervice of his Generation, to be inſtrumental to the Lord (if the Lord pleaſe to employ him) for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward of the great work in his Generation, wherein God hath caſt him; he is willing alſo to lay down himſelf and his comforts, at the foot-ſtool of God, this is a ſingular thing, I ſay, to give up all to God whatſoever he hath; he is willing that the Lord ſhould take him, his comforts, his gifts, his riches, and whatſoever he hath, and improve it for his own honour, that if the Lord ſhould ſay it's mine, if God ſhould call for it, if it ſhall be ſaid the Lord has need of it, he reſigns it, he is preſently willing to let it go, though it be a comfort never ſo dear to him, he counts it an honour if God will take him and his, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is and hath, that God may improve him and his, for his honour; he deſires to lie low before him,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42593:121"/> even in the duſt. Yea, to follow Goſpel Precepts is another thing which is required, as to love enemies, this alſo he deſires to do; theſe are ſingular things, to pray for them that perſecute, to requite evil with good, to forgive wrongs and injuries, though thy brother offend ſeventy times ſeven in a day, yet if he comes and ſaies, it repents me that I have done thee wrong; theſe are Goſpel Precepts that are hard to fleſh and blood, but he that walks with God, deſires to follow him even in this command alſo; That's the third part of this character of him that walks with God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, He deſires to yield obedience unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commandment, I ſay, he deſires to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to every Commandment of the Lord, there's no jot, no tittle of the Word of the Lord but is precious to him, and therefore he hath no reſervation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he doth not ſay, I'le do any other but this, I'le obey any Commandment but ſuch a Precept; I can't walk in ſuch a way with God, though it be cleared up to be a duty: but he that walks with God, yields Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience, he will not indent with God, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to himſelf, no exemption from any Word or Law of God, he ſaies not as <hi>Nahaman, God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me in this;</hi> no, he deſires to yield univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though he ſees he comes ſhort of his deſires, and his obedience is ſcant, ſo that he dares not rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his obedience, he dares not truſt to his obedience, to be juſtified by it, yet it is his deſire to come off in all things, and he hath no reſervation to himſelf, to ſay, if I embrace ſuch a truth, and walk in ſuch a way with God, it won't ſtand with my credit, I ſhall loſe my friends, my name, my eſteem in the world, my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom or trade, and the like; I ſay, he that walks with God hath no ſuch reſervation; That's a fourth. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:42593:122"/>5. Fifthly, He that walk with God will hold faſt his profeſſion, though all the world forſake him, though he be left alone, or though there be a very few that walk with him: ſo did <hi>Elijah, Lord, they have killed thy Prophets,</hi> ſaid he, and <hi>I am left alone, and they ſeek my life,</hi> and yet <hi>Elijah</hi> did not forſake the truth, nor let go his profeſſion, for he knows that there's a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God will be with him; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with him, and the preſence of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all creatures, and he ſhall have no cauſe to complain that he is alone ſo long as the Lord is with him: he alſo conſiders that there's a time when multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ſhall be given in to Chriſt, and therefore he is not diſcouraged, though there be but few for the preſent; he looks to the promiſe, and there he ſees much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, there is a promiſe that <hi>they ſhall flow as Doves to the windows;</hi> it's ſaid that <hi>a little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one ſhall become a great Nation;</hi> the Lord hath ſaid there ſhall be thouſands where there is but one, and a little flock ſhall become a multitude: the Lord hath ſpoken it, and he will haſten it in his time; and therefore though for the preſent he ſees but few that walk with him whilſt he walks with God, yet he is not diſcouraged. But again in the</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixth place, He that walks with God is gracious and conſcientious in his duty in private as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; this is another part of his character, I ſay, he is kept in his duty in private as well as in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; he dare not be remiſs, though no eye ſee him, though there's none in the world to take notice of it, he knows he is in the eye of the Lord, and what he doth is unto the Lord, and therefore he doth it even with all his might. There are ſome in the world that make a fair ſhew before men, and in the mean time they care not what they are in ſecret: zealous before the world, <hi>Jehu</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:42593:122"/> like, <hi>Come and ſee my zeal,</hi> but cold and remiſs in ſecret: and ſo will give fair words before men, good words when there are witneſſes, but when they are in ſecret and in private, in their Families, and the like, they care not what rage they go in, and how they play the Tyrants. But now he that walks with God is as careful of his duty in private as in publick: If it be his duty to give Alms, he'll give as much where there is no witneſs to take notice, as if there were a thouſand eyes before him, as before God and his own ſoul; he dare not be remiſs there, if remiſſneſs ſteal in upon him, it is his burden, and he is never ſatisfied till his ſoul be brought into ſuch a frame, to be as conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious of that duty which he owes to God in ſecret and private, as of thoſe duties which the world takes notice of.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But again, Seventhly, He that walks with God is careful to uſe all means by which he may get nigher God, and to ſhun all occaſions of ſin which ſet the ſoul at a diſtance from God; I ſay, it deſires to uſe all means that are of Gods appointment for getting nigher unto God; he will wait upon God in every Ordinance, and Adminiſtration of the Word, and ſeals, in reading and prayer, in communion and fellowſhip, he willingly neglects no duty, they are the Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt, he looks upon them all as ſo many Conduit Pipes by which the Lord conveys himſelf unto his people: they are golden pipes through which the Lord pours abundance of golden oyl into the ſouls of thoſe that wait for him; he looks upon the Promiſe that is annexed to them, that God has promiſed to be there and to make them bleſſings to his people, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will wait upon God in them, though it may be for the preſent he don't find thoſe In-comes of grace and ſtrength which his ſoul longs after, though it may be
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42593:123"/> he can't (ſometimes) reliſh the Ordinance and taſte ſweetneſs in it, yet ſtill he looks upon it as the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, and dares not turn his back on it; he'll rather accuſe himſelf, his own deadneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart, and ſtraitneſs, he will not accuſe Chriſt and the Ordinance of emptineſs, for he knows Chriſt hath bleſſed it, and his people have found ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, it's the way in which Chriſt hath promiſed to walk, and therefore he will go and lie in the way, he'll go and climb upon the Sycamore Tree, as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> did, he'll climb up on every ordinance, if at any time he may ſee the face of God, if he may ſee Chriſt paſſing by, for his ſatisfaction he uſes all means and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that are of Chriſts Inſtitution, which may be helps to him in his way to Chriſt, and ſhuns all occaſions to ſin, all provocations unto luſt, he dare not meddle with ſin, no not with the leaſt ſin; he knows that ſin is a moſt woful deceiver, if he have but the leaſt countenance he ſoon winds himſelf into the ſoul, and it's hard to wind him out when he hath got himſelf in: he knows that there's a woful corrupt heart within, and that its natural diſpoſition is like to dry Tinder, and is ready to receive every ſpark of temptation that the Devil is like to ſtrike in, and if a ſpark falls in, how ſoon it ariſes to a flame, and how hard it is to quench it; and therefore how doth he riſe againſt ſin, and the occaſions of ſin! he is afraid of thoſe things which other men count niceties and punctilio's, and the like, or they may go under the colour of lawfulneſs; Ay, but he is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of it, he knows that the leaſt ſin coſt blood, the blood of the Son of God, and the guilt of the leaſt tranſgreſſion can't be waſh'd away without the blood of the Son of God, it will coſt blood to waſh away the leaſt ſin as well as the greateſt, and therefore he dare not be bold to meddle with the leaſt ſin, but he ſhuns
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42593:123"/> the very occaſions and provocations unto ſin: That's the ſeventh.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eighthly, He approves of, and deſires to walk in the ſtricteſt way: This is another part of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; he that walks with God approves of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to walk in the ſtricteſt way; he knows it's a great journey, and he had need take the ſtraighteſt line, he is willing to engage himſelf in the ſtricteſt way; if any way hold forth more of God and Chriſt, if any way be more oppoſite to fleſh and blood, if any way be a further ingagement to him to keep cloſe to God, and bind up his heart that it may not ſo ſtart aſide, he is willing to walk with God even in that way, there he knows that that's the rule, <hi>Be ye perfect as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is perfect;</hi> perfection is in his eye, and therefore he knows he can never be be too ſtrict, too holy, walk too cloſe with God, get too nigh God, nor do too much for God: this he laies down as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Some meaſure of holineſs, and of ſtrictneſs many of the world will approve of, but to be ſo ſtrict is to be too imprudent, in their account; but I ſay, he that walks with God, knows that his engagements are ſuch as he can never do too much for God, when he hath done his utmoſt, if he could do ten thouſand times more, he might ſay he is an unprofitable ſervant: That's the Eighth. But again,</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninthly, He that walks with God will uſe no unlawful means to deliver himſelf: this is another part of his Character; he uſes no unlawful means to free himſelf, though his liberty be at ſtake, though his life be at ſtake, he will not deliver himſelf by any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſe: thus it was with <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himſelf if he would have taken an unlawful courſe: in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. it's ſaid there, that <hi>Feſtus</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have received money from him, in the latter end
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42593:124"/> of the Chapter, and if he would have given a Bribe, he might have been delivered; but he would not uſe ſuch unlawful means for his deliverance, to open a door for ſuch an eſcape, he would not give a Bribe to the corrupt Judge, I ſay, he would rather wait upon God for the opening a door that he may eſcape: in every eſtate and low condition he remembers, he that believes makes not too much haſt, he remembers it's good not to make too much haſt, he won't break Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till God ſet him free, till God ſhall open a door for his eſcape, out of any afflicted or tempted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he is brought into: That's the Ninth.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the tenth and laſt place, It is his deſire to gain time, to redeem time from the world, and from his employments in the world, that he may converſe more with God, and with his own heart: I ſay, it is his great deſire, his care to redeem time from the world, that he may converſe with God, and converſe with his own heart, and therefore he is a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with time, he husbands his time well, that the great things of God may not be ſhut out; he knows that they are of great concernment, the things of God, and the things of the world to come are of greateſt concernment, he is haſtening to Eternity, here's no ſtay here, here he is upon the bridge and going over to another world, to Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns him above all to look after the things of that Eternity; he is alwaies beſt when he is with God, he hath found ſweetneſs with God, he knows what it is to enjoy communion with God, and becauſe he hath been with Chriſt upon the Mount, therefore he deſires to go often thither, ſets the world apart, that ſo he may converſe with God, that he may behold the face of Jeſus Chriſt: he knows how deceitful his own heart is, that he had need ſearch continually, make a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42593:124"/> ſearch; Oh, there's a depth of iniquity, a depth of deceit that can hardly be found out: Oh, it will harbour ſome luſt or other, if diligent ſearch be not made, it's to comply with an enemy, and to harbour ſuch an enemy that will ſeek the very deſtruction of the ſoul: I ſay, theſe things he hath known in part through grace of the great concernments and things of the world to come, and the ſweetneſs, preciouſneſs of that communion which the ſoul hath with Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore it is his daily care to husband his time as well as he may, that he may gain time from the world, and from the ſecular employments thereof; and this is the laſt Character that I ſhall name of him that walks with God: And ſo much ſhall ſerve for this time.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have given you part of the Character of one that walks with God. Now I ſhall ſhew you what he is in his calling, in his ordinary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God hath ſet him in, for he walks with God in his calling, as well as in thoſe duties that do more immediately concern God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt of all, He looks upon his Calling that God hath ſet him in as an Ordinance of God: I ſay, he looks upon it as an Ordinance of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſubmits unto it, and endeavours to be faithful in it: He knows it's laid upon all men, in <hi>Gen. 3. 19. In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread;</hi> there are ſome bad drones that fortifie themſelves againſt this Scripture, and ſay, this is only the Curſe, <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread:</hi> but now the Curſe is taken away by Chriſt for his people, and therefore they ought to work no longer; as <hi>the Lilies in the Field, they neither ſow nor reap, but yet are cloathed:</hi> but now he that walks with God looks upon that Scripture not only as a Curſe, but as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42593:125"/> a Commandment, <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread;</hi> it's the Commandment of God, and the Commandment holds though the Curſe be taken away: Man was enjoyned to labour in the ſtate of Innocency, when there was no Curſe; God made him, and it's ſaid, he put him into the Garden to <hi>dreſs it:</hi> yea the very Angels, <hi>Heb. 1. 14. Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth for the good of his Saints?</hi> They all work, they have all their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there's not one Angel in Heaven that is idle; God himſelf is a pure Actor, he is an active Spirit, he is alwaies working, ſo ſaies our Saviour, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worketh hitherto, and I work:</hi> though he ceaſed from the works of Creation, yet God hath been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſince, he worketh hitherto every day, and I work: So that he that walks with God looks upon his Calling as an Ordinance of God, and ſees the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in it, in appointing ſuch a way for man, there's abundance of wiſdom in it; by this means wicked men are kept from being deſperately wicked; if there were no work, no employment for them, there would be a ſtudying of wickedneſs, a plotting and contriving of wickedneſs, ſin would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come out of meaſure ſinful, it would break from all banks and bounds, the whole earth would commit vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; nay, it's good for Gods own people, whilſt they are in the world, to have employment, for by this means they are kept from many a ſnare, and many a temptation they are freed from: an idle man tempts the Devil; the Devil tempts man, and an idle man tempts the Devil unto thoſe woful ſnares which others (being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed) are freed from; a man that walks with God looks upon his Calling God hath ſet him in, as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God. But then again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, He deſires to do all the works of his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42593:126"/> Calling as unto God: that's another part of his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in his Calling; he deſires to do all the works of his Calling as unto the Lord: he knows that he hath to do with God, yea even then when he is ſerving of man, that he hath not only to do with God in the things of his worſhip, not only when he comes before God in Ordinances, and in duties, when he reads and when he prays, and when he hears; moſt men confeſs then they have to do with God; but he that walks with God knows he hath to do with God, when he is in his Calling, and therefore he takes that Counſel which is given him by the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 31. And they that uſe this world as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of the world paſſes away:</hi> He uſes the world as if he uſed it not, becauſe he knows he hath to do with God in the things of the world. Now he hath to do for God, and doth all for the Lord,</p>
            <p>Firſt, As he ſees there's a truſt committed to him from God, and this is an engagement to faithfulneſs; his Calling is a Talent, it's one of the Talents that God hath given him, and therefore it's a truſt that lies upon him, and therefore this is an engagement to faithfulneſs; yea, and he looks upon himſelf as one that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God how he hath carried himſelf, not only in the waies of Gods worſhip, but how he hath carried himſelf in his Calling, with what faithfulneſs he hath performed the works of it; thus he eyes God in it, and he doth it as unto the Lord, as he makes God the great end of all that he doth; thus he performs the work of his Calling, as in it he makes God the great and laſt end. It's true, there are other ſubordinate ends which he looks at, and he may, even when he is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in his Calling, as to gain a comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for himſelf and his family, and that he may give to others as need be, and the like, but the main
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42593:126"/> end is for the glory of God, that God may ſerve himſelf of him, that God may improve him, and that he may be an Inſtrument of much good in his place and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and truly where men don't propound this, and make God the great end, there muſt needs be woful miſcarriages in all that they take in hand; when men know no other end but to gain the world and heap up riches, and to build their Neſts on high, and the like; when this is the only end that they propound in the work of their Calling, it's the way to all injuſtice, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, fraud and deceit, and forgetfulneſs of God, and a whole flood of iniquity comes in: but he that walks with God, his aim is that God may have glory, and that he may be the great and laſt end, and therefore though he doth not gain much in the obtaining of thoſe ſubordinate ends, yet he is faithful in his Calling, he goes on in obedience to Gods command, and to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Generation. That's a ſecond particular, he that walks with God in his Calling, doth all as unto the Lord, he is the laſt end he looks at.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But again, Thirdly, He deſires to be holy and ſpiritually minded whilſt he is in his outward employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that's another part of his walking with God; he deſires to be holy in the midſt of the world, and therefore it is that he takes that Counſel that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives in 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 31. To uſe the world as not abuſing it, becauſe the time is ſhort, and the faſhion of the world paſſeth away;</hi> he bewails nothing more than a carnal heart whilſt he is in the world, it's death to him, it's worſe than death: <hi>To be ſpiritually minded is life and peace, but to be carnally minded is death;</hi> therefore he looks upon that Scripture with joy, that doth propheſie of holineſs, abundance of holineſs that ſhall be given out in that day, in <hi>Zach. 14. 20. In that day there ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord upon the Bells
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42593:127"/> of Horſes:</hi> he looks upon that Scripture, and his heart doth cloſe with it as a gracious promiſe; he prays for the accompliſhment of it, his heart leaps within him to think that there is a time coming when there ſhall be holineſs to the Lord in the converſations of all his people in their employments: that though their hands be put to the things of the world, yet their hearts ſhall be up, their hearts ſhall be breathing after God, the heart ſhall be converſing with Chriſt; he knows that his Calling was made for him, and not he for his Calling, it was made to be ſubſervient to his beſt good, to be a ſervant to him, not to be his Maſter, and therefore ſtill he deſires to keep his heart free for God; he knows that if he make a God of the world, the world will make a ſlave of him, and therefore he deſires to walk as one that Chriſt hath made free, and ſtill his heart is breathing and thirſting after God, whilſt he is in the midſt of worldly Employments. That's a Third.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, Fourthly, He that walks with God in his Calling, is careful to ſanctifie all by the Word and Prayer, ſo ſaies the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. All things are ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer:</hi> he knows that there's a Curſe upon the whole Creation, ſin hath brought a curſe upon every creature, there's a curſe upon every way of man, there's a curſe and a ſnare in every Calling, in every Employment that man ſets his hand unto, and therefore it is his deſire that all may be ſanctified unto him; he knows that the creature is not comfortable, no condition comfortable, unleſs God be kept cloſe to the creature, and therefore he looks up continually to God for his bleſſing, that all may be ſanctified to him; he knows that the earth can bring forth nothing but Bryars and Thorns, it's the curſe of the world, and ſo it's the curſe of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42593:127"/> that though he plough and ſow, and though he labour with never ſo much induſtry, his Calling brings forth nothing but Bryars and Thorns, he meets with nothing but vanity and vexation, croſſes and moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that which is worſt of all, he is not able to bear them, therefore he deſires that all may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto him by Word and Prayer; he knows that it's not the induſtry of man that makes rich, it's not the bleſſing of the hand unleſs the Word of God goes along with it: in all his waies to take God along, that ſo he may have the bleſſing of the Lord upon the works and labours of his hand. That's a fourth. Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, He is careful that the world and his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward employments don't juſtle out the things of God: This is another part of his walking with God in his Calling; he knows the things of God are of greateſt concernment: his Calling and the things of this world are but for a time, for this moment, whilſt he is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling over the bridge to Eternity, and therefore he knows he ſhall wrong his own ſoul, if the cares of the world, and the things of the world, and over-eager purſuit after the world, ſhould hinder him in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit after God and Chriſt: He looks upon that as good counſel which Chriſt gives in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. ſaies he there, <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the firſt place, and all things ſhall be added:</hi> Let the things of God have the preheminence, he gives them the precedency in his heart and affections, in his practice and purſuit, ſtill the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs of it is ſought in the firſt place: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſires to ſet up God above the world, and ſaies, Lord, ſit thou here, ſit thou here in the higheſt place, ſit thou in my heart, in the excellency of my ſpirit, let the things of God have the precedency; and as for the world, Thou world ſit thou at my foot-ſtool;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42593:128"/> he ſaies to the world as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to his Servants, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 5. when he went to ſacrifice his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he ſaies to the young men, <hi>Stand you here, and I and the Lad will go up to the Mount and worſhip:</hi> and thus ſaies the heart to the world, World ſtand thou here, Calling, Employment, ſtand thou here till I go up yonder and worſhip, till I go and converſe with God, and behold the face of Chriſt, ſtay thou here in the Valley till I go up to the Mount and worſhip: for he gives the things of God and Chriſt the precedency, becauſe he knows they abide for ever, the Word of the Lord that abides for ever, and ſo the love of God and Chriſt abide for ever, and communion with God and Chriſt endures for ever, the Image of Chriſt upon his ſoul endures for ever, he therefore gives theſe the precedency in his affections, and in his purſuit; therefore it is, that he is not willing to graſp too much of the world, he is fearful to graſp too much of the world, to have more of the world than he knows how to manage with the performance of his duty to God, he is fearful, I ſay, that the world ſhould juſtle out his betters, and therefore will not graſp too much of the world, and is careful ſo to order the things of the world, as that he may gain time to ſeek after the great things of God and Chriſt. That's a Fifth particular. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, He that walks with God in his Calling lives by Faith: he lives by faith whilſt he works in his Calling; he doth not only live by faith for the things of heaven, he doth not only exerciſe faith, for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the world to come, but he lives by faith in his Calling, and therefore he goes on chearfully, he knows his perſon and his works are accepted, whatſover his work is though never ſo mean it's accepted, and all his labours, and faithfulneſs in his Calling are accepted:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42593:128"/> he exerciſes his faith for the covering of his infirmities, he knows that he is ſubject to diſhonour God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there's much weakneſs doth eſcape from him whilſt he is in the world, and therefore he exerciſes his faith for the covering of thoſe infirmities; he lives by faith for the protection of God in his Calling, thus he lives by faith: he knows there's a promiſe, and he lives upon it, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy waies, that thou daſh not thy foot againſt a ſtone:</hi> In all thy waies, in every good and lawful way in thy Calling there is a promiſe of protection, and he lives by faith upon this promiſe: And there is a promiſe of bleſſing alſo, <hi>Bleſſed art thou coming in, and bleſſed art thou going out,</hi> and he exerciſes faith in that promiſe alſo. That's another part of his walking with God. But again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, He is careful to avoid thoſe ſtumbling blocks and ſnares that might endanger him in his walking with God; that's another part of his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God: It's commendable for men to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in their Calling, but how many ſtumbling-blocks on the right-hand and on the left, that men daſh againſt, and ſo loſe all their induſtry and diligence by daſhing againſt thoſe ſtumbling blocks! One ſtumbles at ſelf-end, ſelf-ſeeking, he propounds himſelf only, and his own good, and therefore he loſes all; others meet with other ſnares and fall into them, deceit, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage and falſhood; ſome are over-eager in their purſuit after the world; and others ſtumble at the ſtone of Slothfulneſs and Idleneſs; it's hard to walk in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way; but he that walks with God knows that there's a ſnare in every condition, and therefore he is watchful againſt thoſe ſnares: Every Calling, every Employment hath ſome ſpecial ſnares and ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks; men that are employed about high things,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42593:129"/> great matters, they meet with one kind of ſnare, men in low conditions meet with another kind of ſnare, every high condition, and every low condition hath its ſnares, and therefore he is careful to obſerve what eſtate, and what the calling and condition in that eſtate that he is in doth moſt expoſe him unto, and he is careful in watching againſt thoſe ſnares therein.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eighthly, Again, In the laſt place, He abides with God in his Calling; that's another part of thoſe that walk with God, he abides with God in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: the Apoſtle gives that counſel in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. about the 15, or 16 Verſes, <hi>That every one ſhould abide in the Calling that God hath ſet them in:</hi> and this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he labours to walk up unto, he is content in the place God hath ſet him, or ſubmits unto it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, and therefore he abides in the way that God hath ſet him in. The Apoſtle doth not mean, that it is not lawful for a man to change his Calling, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that may be done upon occaſion; the Merchant may turn Husbandman, or the Husbandman may turn Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, if he ſees occaſion for it: but God would have his people to abide in their Callings, not raſhly to change them, but to ſee God in them, and ſubmit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with content. Thus you ſee what that man is that walks with God; if you follow him in his ordinary works and employments, you ſhall find him ſuch in the waies of his Calling, and therefore oh that you would look up to the Lord to make this truth practical to you. Truly theſe are high leſſons, but they are ſuch as every gracious heart is breathing after, and following hard unto, and bewails wherein it comes ſhort; I ſay, this is or ſhould be found in every gracious heart, therefore look unto God that he may make you ſuch whilſt you walk in your Callings. Oh it were a bleſſed time Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren if all your hearts were brought up to this, thus
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42593:129"/> to walk with God (as you have heard) in your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, we ſhould ſoon ſee the new heavens that is ſpoken of, God hath promiſed to create new heavens and new earth, if mens hearts were once ſet to walk thus with God in his waies, and in their employments, we ſhould ſoon ſee new earth, men muſt be new, new hearts, new converſations, firſt new men and then a new world, look up to the Lord to make you thus faithful in your Callings; it's the main thing that God looks after, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, walking with him whilſt we are performing the works of our Calling; it's not ſo much the Calling that God regards, but your faithfulneſs in it let the Calling be what it will: if a man have a Calling never ſo honourable, yet if he be not faithful in it, he is no way pleaſing to God; and on the other ſide, if a man have a Calling never ſo mean, and never ſo low, yet if he be faithful in it, it's well pleaſing to God: oh it's that which will ſtick by you, yea, it's that which will follow you when you leave the world: your Callings can't follow you, they muſt leave you, they muſt be left behind below, but thy faithfulneſs, that faithfulneſs that hath been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in thy employment, and in thy work, that will never leave thy ſoul, that will follow it even unto heaven: and now you that fear the Lord, though others be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, yet you are engaged to faithfulneſs, you are ingaged to walk with God in the works of your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for you have the promiſe of protection, you have the promiſe of bleſſing, this is ingagement to you, you have a promiſe that the Lord will be with you, that his Angels ſhall be with you, that they ſhall keep you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually when you are in your way, and in the works of your Calling, and therefore this is an engagement unto you, and you have the promiſe of bleſſing: the Lord if he bleſs you in your way, what an engagement is this unto you to be faithful! he will not only be with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42593:130"/> you when you are in thoſe duties that do more nearly concern his worſhip, but he hath promiſed to be with you by his protection, and by his bleſſing even whilſt you are in the works of your Calling, and therefore walk up to God there in your Calling; it's a Talent left to you by God, and it doth engage an ingenious man to be faithful, therein you are betruſted, and herein an inſtrument to do good to ſouls and bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are engaged herein as it is your duty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be faithful in all; Oh what encouragement is here, for Chriſtians to conſider this, whatſoever their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, though never ſo mean, they are accepted in it, the Lord accepts it, while they ſtudy faithfulneſs to carry it faithfully in a mans Calling, in the meaneſt work that ever they took in hand they are accepted, as if their work were the moſt honourable work in the world, and therefore if you have acceptance, not only when you come before God in his worſhip, but when you are in your own waies, in your Callings and Employments your perſon and works are accepted, it's a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement unto you to be found faithful in the works of your Calling. And ſo much for this time.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have given you part of the Character of one that walked with God, and ſhewed you what he is in thoſe duties that do more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God himſelf: I ſhewed you (the laſt time I ſpake) what his carriage is in his Calling, in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary employment: he looks upon his Calling as an Ordinance of God. God who is an active Spirit can't endure that any of his creatures ſhould be idle; the very Angels have their employment, there's never an Angel in heaven idle; <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. they <hi>are all mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth for the good of them that ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And therefore out of this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſubmits unto the way of his Calling, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be faithful in it; he alſo deſires to do all that he doth to the Lord, even the very works of his calling he doth them to the Lord; he looks upon it as a truſt from God, and by that truſt he is engaged to faithfulneſs; and he deſires to make God his laſt end: there's a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42593:131"/> end, beſides the gain of riches and living in the world, there's a further end which he eyes, which is more honourable, more noble, and that is to ſerve God in his Generation, that he may be an inſtrument in the hand of God to do ſome good in his Generation, that God may have the glory of it; this is the laſt end, and ſo he doth all as to the Lord: he deſires alſo to be holy and ſpiritual in the midſt of his Calling, though his hand be to the earth, he deſires that his heart may be upright, he groans under the burden of a carnal heart, it's worſe than death to him to be carnally mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he rejoices in the promiſe of holineſs, and in that Prophecie in <hi>Zachariah, In that day holineſs ſhall be written to the Lord upon the Bells of Horſes;</hi> there's a promiſe that Gods people ſhall be holy when they are in the world, in the midſt of their Callings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, holineſs ſhall be written to the Lord upon them; he rejoices to think that that time is a coming, he prays and waits to ſee the accompliſhment of it in his own ſpirit: he deſires to ſanctifie all by the Word and Prayer; he knows it's the bleſſing of the Lord, and not his own endeavours that can make him proſperous in his Calling; he deſires alſo that the things of the world don't ſhut out the things of God; that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his walking with God. Oh how fearful is he to graſp too much of the world, how fearful is he that the things of the world ſhould deprive him of thoſe opportunities of waiting upon God, of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Lord, and with his own ſpirit! He doth not live upon his own endeavours, but he lives by faith, whilſt he works with his hand; he exerciſes faith in the promiſe for protection, bleſſing and acceptance. He deſires alſo to ſhun all thoſe ſnares and temptations that are in the way of his Calling; as every Calling hath its ſpecial ſnare and temptation, he deſires there
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42593:131"/> to be moſt watchful where there is moſt likelihood he ſhould ſlip and fall, and be ſnared and broken; he prays and watches againſt the temptations that are in his way, and is willing to abide with God in his Calling. I ſhall now come to ſhew you what this perſon is in his <hi>Relations:</hi> One that walks with God you ſhall find active, gracious, carry it graciouſly in his <hi>Relations:</hi> And I ſhall only ſpeak now of Family Relations, and there's ſome need we ſhould ſpeak of that: It ſeems to be hinted in the Text, That <hi>Enoch</hi> was faithful with God in his Family; and this was mentioned, That <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God after he begat <hi>Methuſalem</hi> three hundred years, and begat ſons and daughters; and as he begat them ſo he brought them up to God, and was found faithful in his family Relations. There are three ſorts, there's that of Husband and Wife, Parent and Child, and Servant and Maſter: I ſhall not ſpeak largely of all theſe, it would be too large a Subject. I ſhall only now give you ſome hints what that gracious perſon is that walks with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, and how he carries it in thoſe ſeveral <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the Relation of the <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> hath God ſet ſuch a perſon in the Relation of a Wife; you ſhall behold her gracious carriage.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, She looks upon her Husband as her head, and ſubmits unto him as one that is ſet over her in the Lord; ſhe knows that there is a priority and a dignity that God hath put upon her husband: the man was firſt, and then the woman, and therefore ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits unto him in all lawful things, though in ſome reſpects he may ſeem to be inferiour to her, though ſhe brought more wealth, though her birth be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, though her parts be more ripe, yet ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits unto him, as one that God hath ſet over her; nay,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42593:132"/> though he may ſeem unworthy to rule, and unworthy of the dignity, yet ſhe ſubmits for the Lords ſake, becauſe it is the Ordinance and Command of God. There are divers things in this ſubmiſſion which are ſeen in a gracious woman that walks with God. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, She thinks and ſpeaks honourably of her Husband, and ſpeaks honourably unto him: you know what was <hi>Mary</hi>'s carriage to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though ſhe might ſeem to be above him, ſhe ſaies, <hi>Thy Father and I have ſought thee:</hi> She doth not ſay, My Father and I, but <hi>Thy Father and I have ſought thee;</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks graciouſly of ſuch gracious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that ſpeak honourably to their Husbands, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. he doth exhort women to imitate <hi>Sarah, Sarah obeyed her husband, and called him Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, As ſhe ſpeaks honourably to him, and of him, ſo ſhe labours to pleaſe him in all lawful things, to conform her ſelf as much as may be unto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands diſpoſition, to win him with her love and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriage; ſhe alſo receives his counſels, and is willing to ſubmit to his reproofs in all things lawful, becauſe ſhe looks upon him as one that the Lord hath ſet over her to be head. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, She looks upon her ſelf as one that the Lord hath given unto her, that ſhe might be a meet help unto him; this is another part of the gracious carriage in a woman; ſhe looks upon her ſelf as one that is given to be a meet help unto her husband, and therefore ſhe deſires to do him good all his daies: ſo ſaies <hi>Solomon</hi> when he ſpeaks of this vertuous woman, in <hi>Prov. 21. 12. She will do him good and not evil all the daies of his life;</hi> ſhe endeavours to help him, and to do him good in his ſoul, body and eſtate, ſhe'll do him good in every condition, in affliction, in low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions when the hand of the Lord is upon him, if the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42593:132"/> hand of the Lord be ſtretched out againſt his eſtate, and bring him low, ſhe ſubmits unto it, and will not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid but comfort him, and be content to take part with him in his affliction and low condition, and all this ſhe doth as unto the Lord, becauſe of the Ordinance of the Lord; and thus you ſee how ſuch a perſon as walks with God carries it in the Relation of a wife. Well, if God ſet ſuch a perſon in the relation of a Husband, you ſhall find him alſo walking with God in that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he loves his wife dearly, and he loves her eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that of God he ſees in her; though he dare not love the creature immediately, nor rejoice nor delight in the creature, becauſe he knows that's Idolatry, yet he loves that which he ſees of God in her, and under God, he loves her next to God with the deareſt love: That, that is the moſt near relation, it's nearer than the Relation of Father and Mother, Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; this is not only a natural but ſupernatural relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a Myſtical relation, and there's a great deal of God in making two to become one, and therefore, I ſay, of that love which is due to, and which he may give unto the creature, he gives unto her the greateſt ſhare, as being the neareſt relation: and becauſe he loves her, you ſhall ſee how he carries himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, He loves her ſoul in the firſt place, and therefore it is that he moſtly deſires to do her good in her ſpirit: therefore it is that he inſtructs and prays with her, and for her, that ſo the Lord may do her good in the inward man: his deareſt love is toward her beſt part, and therefore he rejoices moſt in that when he ſees the work of God upon her heart: when they can live together as heirs, co-heirs of the grace of life, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that is it that he takes the moſt contentment in. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42593:133"/>2. Secondly, Alſo becauſe he loves her, he won't be bitter to her, he will remember that rule in <hi>Col. 3. 19. Husbands love your Wives and be not bitter againſt them:</hi> he will not be bitter in word nor action; he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her weakneſs, looks upon her as the weaker veſſel, and therefore he will not break her; if he muſt chide and fight, it ſhall be with himſelf, and with thoſe luſts that are within him and war againſt his ſoul, and not with that relation that the Lord hath given to be ſuch a wife and ſuch a comfort unto him in this his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Becauſe he loves her, he will defend her; this is another part of his gracious carriage; he will be a veil for a covering to her: ſo <hi>Abimelech</hi> told <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Lo, thy husband is a covering to thee where ever thou goeſt:</hi> he will right her cauſe againſt all wrongs and injuries in a lawful way, ſo far as he is able,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, He covers her weakneſſes; that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his carriage; he remembers that rule that is given unto husbands, <hi>Husbands love your Wives,</hi> in <hi>Epheſ. 5. 25. as Chriſt loved his Church;</hi> Why, Chriſt covered the infirmities of the Church: though there be a great deal amiſs, yet he puts his raiment upon her; when ever he preſents his people unto his Father, he preſents them as if there were no ſpot in them, as if they were holy and perfect, <hi>Thou art all fair my love,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and there is no ſpot in thee:</hi> Why, ſo this man that walks with God won't blaze abroad the infirmities of his Wife, but is willing to cover them, for he knows what the Lord Jeſus hath covered in reſpect to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, Fifthly, Becauſe he loves her he will maintain her, that ſhe may want no conveniencies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his rank and the condition that God hath ſet him in: he won't keep her ſhort of neceſſaries,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42593:133"/> but provide both for her neceſſity and dignity; he won't ſpend all her portion, and then turn her out of doors to provide for her ſelf: he won't keep her ſhort, that ſhe ſhall have no opportunity to do good, but he gives her allowance to ſhare with him, and to take comfort together of that which God hath given him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, Sixthly and laſtly, He will maintain her honour in the Family, and therefore he commands that ſhe be reſpected: he will not ſuffer ſervants nor children to uſurp authority over her, but commands that reverence be ſhewed, and ſubmiſſion given to her over all the Family; he looks upon her as one that God hath ſet (next himſelf) to be the next light of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and therefore deſires that ſhe might ſhare and be reſpected; he knows that God hath given her to be a help, and (ſo under him) to look to the waies of her Family, Children and Maidens, and therefore in this he doth countenance her, leſt the Family be diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and God be diſhonoured in it, this he doth as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord and for his ſake (though there may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs on her part) becauſe it's the Ordinance and appointment of God: Thus you ſee what is the work of the firſt Relation of Husband and Wife.</p>
            <p>2. But Secondly, The ſecond Relation in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is of Children and Parents: Now if a gracious heart, as one that walks with God, be ſuch in either of theſe relations, you ſhall ſee his gracious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, to ſpeak in relation to Children: If God hath ſet him as a Child, he deſires to obey his Parents in all things in the Lord; he deſires to give willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience unto them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, and that from the very heart, he obeys them as Chriſt obeyed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in <hi>Pſal. 40. 7, 8. Lo, I come to do thy Will, I delight to do thy Will, O God, thy Law is in my heart;</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:42593:134"/> and this is the carriage of a gracious Child, one that walks with God, to his Parents, he obeys them from the heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, He alſo ſubmits unto all their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he embraces the wholſom counſel of his Parents, <hi>He will not deſpiſe the counſel of his Father, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Law of his Mother, but he wears them as an Ornament of Grace to his head, and as a Chain,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alſo doth ſubmit unto all their reproofs and chaſtenings, becauſe he looks upon them as the reproofs and chaſtenings of a Father, and ſo proceed from love, and they are for his good. He alſo</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, Is content that they ſhould diſpoſe of him for Calling, for Employment: he is willing that they ſhould diſpoſe of him in Marriage, he knows that they have a great ſhare of him, and therefore he will not diſpoſe of himſelf without their conſent. He alſo in</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Fifth and laſt place, Looks upon himſelf as alwaies bound, even all his daies, to love and honour, and to reſpect his Parents; though God hath given him a Family of his own, and though he be ſet free from their Government, yet he looks upon himſelf all his daies bound to honour and reſpect them, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, if the hand of the Lord be upon them to ſhorten their comforts, and if his be lengthened our, he looks upon himſelf as bound to relieve their wants, and to be a comfort and ſtay unto them in their old age: this is the carriage of one that walks with God, if he be found in the relation of a Child. But for the relation of a Father.</p>
            <p>If he ſtand in the relation of a Parent, you ſhall alſo ſee his gracious carriage:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:42593:134"/>1. Firſt of all, He looks upon his Children as given him of God, to be brought up for God; he knows that they are but only ſent out to Nurſe (as it were) to him: God hath given him ſuch and ſuch Children to train up in his fear, and therefore it is his great deſire to ſee the Image of God upon them; he is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that they ſhould be made rich in grace than in gold, therefore he prays for them, counſels them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them, gives them good examples, and all that ſo the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt may be communicated unto them; if the Lord have pleaſed (at any time) to work upon the hearts of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Oh how thankful is he unto the Lord for it! And he rejoices a thouſand times more, even in this, that he knows that they are the Lords, than that they are his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, He will not bear with that which is evil in them, though they be never ſo nigh to him, though they be of his fleſh, yet he will not bear with that which is a diſhonour to God: he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that in a Child which he abhors in another, which he will reprove, nay (it may be puniſh in a ſervant: but he is impartial in the matters of God, when Gods honour is concerned in it, he won't connive at any wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, And on the other ſide, He is careful not to provoke them to wrath; for that's another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; he remembers that that is a Precept, <hi>Fathers, provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord;</hi> he deſires rather, if it be poſſible, to rule them by love than by fear, he knows that ſlaviſh fear is the ſeed of a great deal of evil, and many times it deſtroies Ingenuity it ſelf; he won't provoke them by cutting words, as <hi>Saul</hi> did his ſon <hi>Jonathan,</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> you ſhall ſee
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42593:135"/> what cutting words he gave to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> a good and gracious ſon, 1 <hi>Sam. 20. 30. Then Sauls anger was kindled againſt Jonathan, and he ſaid unto him, Thou ſon of the perverſe rebellious woman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, He will not deny them conveniencies, and that education that is fit for them, but he is careful to diſpoſe of them in the way of a lawful Calling, he ſets them in a good way that they may be ſerviceable to the Lord and their Generation, according to the Will of the Lord, when he is dead and gone.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, He won't fall upon them with violence before he knows the matter and examines the cauſe, leſt he ſhould ſmite them without cauſe; he will not caſt them off for every offence, but he ſeeks the Lord for them, and waits long for their return: he prays and prays again that the Lord would bring them home unto himſelf; and if at any time the Lord gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he looks upon it as a great mercy, and his heart is drawn forth in thankfulneſs; and this is the carriage of one that walks with God in the relation of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>There is a third relation in which I ſhall be more ſhort, and that is, That of Servant and Maſter. Now if God ſet a gracious ſoul in this relation, ye ſhall ſee his carriage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, If he be a Servant, he is content with his condition, he remembers that the Lord Jeſus himſelf was found in the form of a Servant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well may he, a poor worm, ſubmit unto that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if the Lord ſet him in it, he remembers he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God in that condition: it is not the work and employment that God looks at, but the faithfulneſs, the faithful carriage of the heart and ſpirit, and the work, though it be never ſo mean, and never ſuch drudgery, if done to the Lord in faithfulneſs, God accepts of it; and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42593:135"/> thus he is Chriſts freeborn of the freewoman, free in the inward man, and doth more willingly and contentedly ſubmit himſelf unto the condition of a Servant, if the Lord be pleaſed to place him in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, As he is a Servant, he yields all due honour, reſpect and obedience unto his Maſter, or to ſuch as God hath ſet over him; he yields obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all things in the Lord: He is alſo careful of the good name and eſtate of his Maſter, whatſoever he is inſtructed in, or truſted with, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were; he is careful of all the eſtate that his Maſter puts into his hand, he will not wrong his Maſter in his eſtate, but he labours by all lawful means to increaſe the eſtate of his Maſter, though he knows he ought not to ſin and deceive for his Maſter, but in all lawful waies he will labour to preſerve and increaſe the eſtate of his Maſter; nay, this he doth in all faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whatſoever his hand finds to do in the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God hath ſet him in, he doth it in all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, whether the eye of his Maſter be upon him or no, he knows the eye of the Lord is upon him; he won't only work when his Maſter looks on him, but when there is no eye upon him, when his Maſter is gone into a far Country; he doth all to the Lord with all ſingleneſs of heart, and therefore he is faithful in the doing of that work and imployment which is put into his hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, He ſubmits unto all reproofs and corrections of his Maſter; he won't Anſwer, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, repine, nor turn again when he is ſmitten, but ſubmits unto his Maſter: he looks upon him as one that God hath ſet over him in the Lord; yea, though he meet with much hardſhip, he is not willing to defame his Maſter, nor that it ſhould be known, but if he be uſed moſt cruelly, in ſuch cruelty as he muſt complain,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42593:136"/> he will complain in an orderly way, as to the Magiſtrate with all meekneſs, that it may be remedied. There is one particular more and I have done, and that is,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, The relation of the Maſter, you ſhall ſee a gracious heart walking with God in this relation alſo that God hath ſet him in as a Maſter. Why,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, He ſeeks after the good of the ſouls of his Servants: he doth not only look to their bodies and no further; he does not uſe his Servant, as he doth his Cattle, only to work and toil them, and ſeek no further, but he looks upon them as committed by God and man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his truſt, and therefore he is bound to be faithful to them, in ſeeking the good of their ſouls in the firſt place: therefore it is that he counſels, inſtructs and prays for them, and above all, he labours to give them good examples in the Family, for he knows all the reſt is nothing, his inſtruction will do no good, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are of no efficacy, if his examples don't go along with them; and ſo Servants may ſee his gracious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and carriage, which will be exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing unto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, He alſo takes care of their outward man; he remembers it's written, that <hi>He that provides not for his Family is worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> and therefore he endeavours to provide food and raiment for them, leſt he ſhould put them upon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and provoke them to ſin, and put them upon temptation to lie and ſteal, and be extravagant; and this is occaſioned many times through the unfaithfulneſs of the Maſter in this particular; he is careful not to expreſs cruelty, one that walks with God won't be cruel to his Servant in laying too much upon him, he knows the groans of his ſervant in this caſe will reach up to heaven; the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſervants to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and you know when they laid heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42593:136"/> upon them, then their cry was heard, and reacht up to heaven; and it was the deſtruction of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians:</hi> A good Maſter won't be cruel in his work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Neither will he be cruel in his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: If he doth correct he will do it in meaſure, he knows he is called the Father of the Family, therefore he ought to carry it as a Father unto his Family, and therefore if he will correct them, he will correct them as his own Children, he'll hate to be cruel to them: And therefore he'll in the</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourth place, Take good counſel from him: a gracious heart, if he ſhall ſpeak to him of God and Chriſt in humility of any diſorders he meets withal in a Family, a gracious heart will receive counſel from an inferiour; you know how <hi>Naaman</hi> carried it, in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 23. now <hi>Naaman</hi> did not reject their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel though he was a great and mighty Warrier; he doth not ſay, What have you to do to teach me? to inſtruct me? Why, ſaies he, it's good counſel, and it's from God, and he had cauſe afterward to bleſs God, that he did through them give him that counſel, for if he had not been, he had ever been Leprous. But,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, He takes care of his Servants: a gracious man pities them in their need, as the Centurion, <hi>My Servant,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>lies (at home) ſick of a Palſie,</hi> and deſires that Chriſt would ſpeak a word for his healing: he does not turn him out of doors, and ſend him to provide for himſelf, but he tenders him, and goes to the Phyſician Chriſt himſelf, and deſires that he would pleaſe to heal his Servant. And then</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly and laſtly, He will not ſend his Servant away empty; that's another part of his carriage: when they have ſerved him many years, and he hath found their faithfulneſs, and the bleſſing of the Lord hath been upon him whilſt they have been with him in the
<pb facs="tcp:42593:137"/> Family, he won't ſend them empty away: God hath laid it as an injunction upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that when their Servants had ſerved them ſo many years, they ſhould not ſend them empty away, but that they ſhould give them ſomething, ſomething of all that they had got: It was the ſin of <hi>Laban, Jacob</hi> had ſerved him fourteen years night and day, and for <hi>Jacob</hi>' ſake the Lord bleſſed <hi>Laban,</hi> now it was his ſin, <hi>The Lord hath ſeen thy cruelty, and the Lord hath rebuked thee;</hi> This is part of the carriage of a gracious heart that walks with God; you have ſeen what he is in all theſe Family Relations that God hath ſet him in, in relation of a Husband and Wife, of Parents and Children, of Maſters and Servants. And ſo much for this time.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>GEN. 5. 24.</bibl> And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am drawing towards a concluſion. I have given you the Character of one that walks with God; I ſhall therefore proceed:</p>
            <p>Having thus given you the Character of one that walks with God, I ſhall ſhew you, that this is a dignity, the excellency of any man or woman upon earth, that they thus walk with God as you have heard. To declare unto you therefore wherein the dignity lies; What is the excellency of a man or woman that doth thus walk with God, will appear in divers particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, This man that thus walks with God, is nearer God than others; he comes into the preſence of God, he is nigh as a ſpecial friend and favourite: that puts dignity upon him; it's the dignity of a man to ſtand in the preſence of a Prince, it's an honour, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: What is it then to ſtand in the preſence of God! it is an Angelical dignity; it's ſaid of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Chriſt ſaies of them, that <hi>they alwaies behold the face of God the Father,</hi> in <hi>Matth. 18. 10. Do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42593:138"/> my little ones, for their Angels alwaies behold the face of their Father;</hi> it's the glory of the Angels that they ever ſtand in the preſence of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face: this is the dignity of one that walks with God, he is nigher God than others. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, He ſees more of God than other men; I ſay, that ſoul that walks with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, ſees more of God than other men; God deals friendly with him, he looks upon him as a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-traveller, he'll impart his mind to him freely, he'll reveal his ſecrets, the myſteries of his Kingdom unto them: he that is nigh God is nigh the light, therefore he ſhall not walk in darkneſs; the Lord goes before him continually, he guides and leads him with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: the light ſhall diſcover the way unto him that he ſhall walk in, <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk in it;</hi> if any man walks with God, it's he that walks thus with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did. That's a ſecond.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But Thirdly, God entertains that ſoul all along his Journey with profitable and delightful diſcourſe. God is ever and anon ſpeaking to him that walks with him, as a man ſpeaks to his friend when he walks with him in his way: and this takes off from the tediouſneſs of the way; though the way be tedious, though it be deep dirty way, yet if a man have a good companion, if he have one to call often to, to diſcourſe pleaſantly, it takes off from the tediouſneſs of the way, it's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and thus doth the Lord carry it towards the ſoul that walks with him, he ſo ſpeaks to the ſoul that it takes from the tediouſneſs of their Pilgrimage, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the tediouſneſs of it whilſt the Lord ſpeaks ſweetly of his love and goodneſs to them; he often calls upon them as a man doth to his friend that he walks with: he enquires into their ſtates, and bids them be of good
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42593:138"/> chear; ſometimes he tells them, that the worſt is paſt, and there's better way behind; he tells them of the reſt they ſhall have at night, or of the good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhall have when they come home; or of the glorious proviſion that is making ready, and though the way be tedious their reſt is long: and this takes off from the tediouſneſs of the way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again in the fourth place, He ſupplies their wants; this is another priviledge that that ſoul hath that walks with God: the Lord will bear all their charges, and take care of them in their Journey, they ſhall not want any thing that is good for them, either for the outward or inward man: this will comfort a man upon his Journey though he have never a penny in his purſe, yet if there be a friend with him, he'll ſay, I have good ſtore, thou ſhalt not want ſo long as I have a penny, I will take care, make proviſion, and pay all; and thus the Lord doth take care of all, he gives them himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Walk before me,</hi> ſaies he to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen. 17. 1. and be thou perfect, and I will make a Covenant with thee:</hi> And what is that? in Verſ. 2. <hi>I will be a God unto thee:</hi> Walk with me and I will be a God unto thee, take care for nothing, I'le bear thy charges all the way; I'le be a God unto thee, I'le ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy wants; the preſence of the Lord ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all comforts, if thou want any thing I'le make it up of my ſelf: I'le be a God unto thee, what wouldſt thou have more? And ſo he takes care to ſupply all the wants of the inward man, he'll make proviſion all the way, he hath laid up ſtore of proviſion in Jeſus Chriſt for them, there is ſtore of righteouſneſs, grace and ſtrength, that his people might want nothing, no not while they are in their Pilgrimage: and therefore he ſaies unto ſuch a ſoul, as ſometimes the Father ſaid to the eldeſt ſon that was brother to the Prodigal in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42593:139"/> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. the latter end of the Chapter, when he was ready to murmur becauſe his Prodigal brother had ſo much kindneſs ſhewed unto him; Why, ſaies his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto him, <hi>Son,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine,</hi> therefore why ſhouldeſt thou murmur, why ſhouldeſt thou repine? thou wanteſt nothing, thou art ever with me, thou enjoyeſt and haſt intereſt in all that I have, it's thine; ſo ſaies the Lord to every ſoul that walks with him, Thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine, I'le take care to ſupply all thy wants. This is another ſpecial priviledge to all thoſe that walk with God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again, Fifthly, He ſupports them; that's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignity and priviledge that the Lord will ſupport them under all their burdens; when they are ready to faint, and ready to give up the Ghoſt many times in their own apprehenſion, he will ſupport their ſpirits, he will take care that they ſhall not fall: if there lie never ſuch preſſures upon them, the Lord will eaſe them, he'll bear with them, he gives them leave (all the way) to lean upon him; this is a moſt ſweet and excellent priviledge that the ſoul hath that walks with God, I ſay, all the way of their Journey, all the way of the Wilderneſs, the Lord gives them leave to lean upon him; when they are weak and fainting, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be diſcouraged, he gives them leave to lean upon him, his righteouſneſs and ſtrength, <hi>Let him take hold on my righteouſneſs, and make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me;</hi> He gives them leave to caſt all burdens upon him, and to venture for Eternity upon him, to lay all the weight of all their cares and fears upon the Lord, that he may ſupport them, and bear their burdens; yea, he doth not only give them leave to lean upon him, but he takes them up in his Arms if they faint at any time, if they fall into a ſwound that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42593:139"/> they can go no farther, the Lord won't go away and leave his fellow-travellers, but he'll take them up in their fainting and ſwounding fits, he brings forth his Spirits and Cordials, and will not leave them until he hath ſet them up again, and made them able to follow him: a gracious promiſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11. the Lord makes there unto his people, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd, and ſhall carry his Lambs in his arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. he'll deal with them as a mother doth with her Child, or as a Shepherd doth with his Lambs, he won't leave them when they'l go no further, but he'll pity and tender them, they have his arm and his boſom when they can't go: he'll help them in all their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſpirit, yea, and in all their preſſures of the outward man too; he'll ſupport and put his arm under them in every affliction, he'll take off the weight of it, and bear the heavieſt end, that end that hath the curſe, the bittereſt, the Lord Jeſus bears that end; he will not break them in their afflictions, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted,</hi> he felt every burden: This is the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous carriage of the Lord towards thoſe that walk with him; and this is a mighty priviledge. That's a Sixth.</p>
            <p>7. Seventhly, The Lord will knock off their bolts and fetters; this is another priviledge, and a mighty one too; the Lord will knock off their Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and he will cauſe them to walk in Liberty: he will deliver them from bondage, he came and died for this very end, <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, and deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their lives long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage;</hi> he will knock off their Fetters, I ſay, even the Chains of their unbelief; the further they go with God, the more cloſe they walk with God, the more liberty they meet with, the more liberty from the chains of luſts: the more nigh they come to God,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42593:140"/> the more doth unbelief vaniſh, it can't ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and the more they walk with God, the more acquaintance, and the more friendly God deals with them as fellow-travellers; though there were a great diſtance between man and man before, yet when they travel together, they will have friendly carriage; ſo a man before he walks with God, there is a great diſtance between God and him, till he condeſcend to the poor low condition of his ſervants, and ſpeak more friendly to them, that they may have more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God; and the more acquaintance they have with God, the more ſhall the Chains of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and the other fetters in their hearts fall off. That's another priviledge.</p>
            <p>8. Again in the eighth place, The Lord will keep them from falling, <hi>He upholds the feet of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he preſerves their goings,</hi> he is round about their path, and preſerves them, <hi>Prov. 2. 8. He keepeth the paths of Judgement, and preſerves the way of his Saints.</hi> He'll diſcover many a ſnare unto them, and teach them how to break thoſe ſnares that others are taken in; and are broken by them; and if the Lord doth ſuffer ſuch a ſoul to fall, it ſhall not lie long, he won't go away and leave him when he is fallen; the Lord takes care of him as his Fellow-traveller, and he will help him up again: when <hi>Peter</hi> fell moſt grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Chriſt did not leave him ſo; Chriſt turned again, did not go away but look'd upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and helpt him up again; yea, the Lord will not only help that ſoul again when he is fallen, but he will make an advantage of his falls; every ſlip, much more every fall ſhall tend to the good of that ſoul that walks with God, God will bring a great deal of good out of the greateſt evil: the Lord will teach him to walk humbly when he ariſes, he'll teach him to walk more fearingly, more
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42593:140"/> circumſpectly, more dependingly, to take hold on Chriſt every ſtep he goes, and to take heed that he ſlide not; nay, he'll cauſe him to gain ground by his falls, he'll make him run ſo much the faſter, when he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf, and ſee what he hath loſt, and how God hath gone a good ſtep from him; Oh, it ſhall be a ſpur unto the ſoul, and it ſhall cauſe him to run ſo much the more earneſtly after God, and to cleave ſo much the more cloſely unto him. Again,</p>
            <p>9. In the Ninth place, The Lord leads the ſoul the ſafeſt and nigheſt way to heaven; I ſay, that ſoul that walks with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, is led the ſafeſt and nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to glory; the ſafeſt way, the Lord will diſcover thoſe pits and ſnares that lie in the way, he will deliver him from thoſe enemies, thoſe robbers, thoſe murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that lie in his way, and he won't lead him about, but bring him the nigheſt way to glory. Many a poor creature that walks not with God, may ſet many a ſtep (as they conceive) towards heaven, but they go about, becauſe they begin not at firſt to walk with God, and therefore come back, they muſt come back again and loſe their labour; yea, many times Gods own people go about becauſe they do not follow God cloſe; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they think to ſave themſelves, and provide for themſelves, to ſhun ſufferings and reproaches, and go about many times to ſhun them, ſo that often they loſe a great deal of way, and come home benighted: but when the ſoul cleaves to God, God leads him the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way, the direct way to glory, that he ſhall not come home be-nighted, he ſhall come home in good ſeaſon becauſe he cleaveth to the Lord, the Lord was his Counſellor and he follows him.</p>
            <p>10. Tenthly, Again, In the laſt place, to name no more; this is another dignity and priviledge, that ſoul that walks with God, ſhall ſit down with God;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42593:141"/> 
               <hi>There remains a reſt,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>for the people of God:</hi> there remains a reſt after their long Journey, their tedious Pilgrimage, they ſhall ſit down with God, they ſhall lie in the boſom of God; after they have walked a while with him on earth, they ſhall ſit down with him for ever, and with his Son at his Table in his Kingdom. You ſee the dignity and priviledge of that ſoul that walks with God: Therefore I ſhall make ſome Application of this. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, Let me ſpeak to thoſe that are ſtrangers to God; to ſuch as yet are found walking in the way of ſinners, a way that God takes no delight in; why, you that are walking in the way of ſinners, are walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way that leads to your own deſtruction; Oh, that the Lord would pluck you (with a mighty hand) out of that deſtroying way; why, you are invited, this day the Lord invites you to come and walk with him, all the priviledges that you have heard, do belong to thoſe that walk with God, they are laid open before you to win upon you, and to invite your ſouls to come in and walk with this God; why will you walk with your worſt enemy? Is he not a mad man that will walk with him that ſeeks to deſtroy him? And yet this is the folly that is in the heart of ſinners: whilſt you walk in the waies of ſin, you walk with your worſt enemy, and walk with <hi>a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> who would make choice of a roaring Lion to devour him? ſinners walk with one that would devour them; Oh, that the Lord would perſwade your hearts to turn in and walk with him, he knocks at your doors to day, he ſtays for you: if there be ever a ſinner that hath any deſires caſt in to walk with God, know that the Lord ſtays for you, he is willing to have your company, and therefore he ſends you this invitation: and therefore I beſeech you, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42593:141"/> the Lord perſwade your hearts to come up to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give up your ſelves to the Lord; this doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do men, this want of coming up to a reſolution is the deſtruction of many poor ſouls, that have many a good motion caſt in; when they hear this of God, and the excellency of thoſe that walk with God, they can't but ſee that there is ſomething of God that is deſirable. But alas, the miſery is, men come not up to a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a fixed reſolution, to make choice of God, and to walk with him, there's ſomething in God that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; Ay, but there's another object that the heart is fixed upon, there's ſomething of the world, there's ſomething in luſt; oh, my friends know it, you can't ſerve God and Mammon, you can't ſerve God and your luſts, Faith can't endure this divided heart, and therefore I beſeech you, look up to the Lord to bring off your hearts to a reſolution, that you may ſay, Well, I'le make choice of the Lord, I'le make choice of the Lord for my portion, let all the world go, ſo I may have God; come up to a reſolution to part with all, though you loſe all, though you loſe your friends, though you loſe your relations and comforts, know that whatever you loſe for the Lords ſake, ſhall be made up abundantly in him: oh, therefore I beſeech you that you would eye that fulneſs that is in God, this may help to bring off the heart, to bring up the ſoul to cloſe in a reſolution, to come up and walk with him: when the ſoul looks and eyes the fulneſs that there is in God, there's whatſoever may anſwer all loſſes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may ſupply all wants, and ſatisfie all deſires, there's a fulneſs in God, a fulneſs of Grace, and a fulneſs of truth is in Chriſt, there's fulneſs of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and contentment, and therefore the Lord being yours, you ſhall not need to go from him, you ſhall not need to go out to ſeek ſatisfaction elſewhere:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42593:142"/> though all the world ſhould forſake, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts leave you, yet there's that in God may anſwer all; and though you part with all your luſts, yea, though you ſhould loſe all the world for the Lords ſake, that you may give up your ſelves to walk with him, know aſſuredly that it will never repent you, you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you: the very firſt day that you walk with God, the very firſt hour of your walking with God, will bring you ſuch contentment and ſatisfaction into your ſpirits that you will not repent you that you have left all your old waies and luſts, all ſin, and all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for the Lords ſake, that ſo you may walk with him. And moreover I beſeech you, that you would make uſe of Jeſus Chriſt in your coming to God: if God ſhall perſwade your hearts, to give up your ſelves to walk with God, make uſe of Chriſt at your firſt coming; there's no man can walk with God at his firſt coming, till the ſon of God makes way for him, <hi>Two cannot walk together except they be agreed;</hi> God and man were fallen out in <hi>Adam,</hi> now theſe muſt be agreed; now, oh let your ſouls breath after Chriſt, you that deſire to walk with God, begin firſt with Chriſt, let your hearts breath after him, look to him as your peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, to be your reconciler, to make God and you one, to bring you into more nigh acquaintance and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, that God and you may be one in Chriſt: Oh, look up unto the righteouſneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt every ſoul of you, you can't walk with God, if you be naked you can't abide his preſence; you know <hi>Adam</hi> ran out from the preſence of God when God walk'd in the Garden, he could not walk becauſe God was there, he runs and hides himſelf; a naked creature can't endure the preſence of God: look up to the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, throw your ſelves as poor naked creatures upon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42593:142"/> of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo coming in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Son unto the Father, you may have friendly acceptance, that you may walk with God for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. One word alſo to thoſe that have intereſt in God and Jeſus Chriſt: Oh, that I might ſtir you up alſo to walk with God, to walk with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did. Brethren, conſider I pray you, Did not Chriſt bring you into acquaintance with the Father for this end? Were not you at a diſtance? ye were ſtrangers, ye were enemies, you were far off from God! what pains did Jeſus take to bring you acquainted with God, that ſo you might walk with him as a man with his friend? It coſt Chriſt dear, it was a hard work to make up the breach, it was a mighty work to bring you into acquaintance with God; do not neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your communion with God in your daily walk, ſeeing it coſt Chriſt ſo dear.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo that God hath made you all for this very end, he hath given you legs that you might walk with him, he hath given ſome ſtrength to thoſe that were lame, that could not ſtand; I ſay, when he brought you home to himſelf, he gave you ſome ſtrength; it was then that he came to open the eyes of the blind, and to ſtrengthen the feet of the lame; and he ſtrengthens their feet that ſo they may walk with God his Father: Is not the Lord your beſt friend? Is he not the ſweeteſt companion you can chooſe? and if ſo, I beſeech you take heed that you do not neglect your walking with him: what, will you leave your friend? will you leave your friend upon the way? Oh do not give the Lord occaſion to accuſe you of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; had you not need to keep cloſe to God, do not you need his preſence, do not you need him to comfort you, to quicken you, to revive you, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42593:143"/> you, to ſupply your wants, to bear your charges, to keep off the blaſts, to rebuke temptations, and to vanquiſh enemies, to help you up when you are fallen, to make advantage of your falls, to lead you the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the ſafeſt way to glory? Oh, that the ſenſe of your weakneſs and infirmities might cauſe you to cleave cloſe to the Lord, and take heed that you don't depart and go out from walking with him: And in your walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, I ſhall but give you a few Directions and conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. In your walking with God be ſure that you follow him in every ſtep, go you where God goes, walk you where God walks, if you mean to keep the preſence of God look to this; Oh, go to the Lord and deſire that he would teach your ſouls where he walks, as the Spouſe, <hi>Tell me (O thou whom my ſoul loveth) where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon:</hi> that ſhe may go there; Why, the Lord walks in his Ordinances, he walks amongſt his people: the Son of God walks in the midſt of his Golden Candleſticks, there's his walk; would you know where to find him, come in his walks, in the midſt of his Golden Candleſticks, in the midſt of his people, in the fellowſhip of his Saints, thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in the beauties of holineſs, in Goſpel order, there the Lord walks; you that expect the preſence of the Lord, that would not loſe that comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his which you might enjoy, take heed you do not turn away, where God hath ſaid he walks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Again, I beſeech you, that you would be alwaies careful to give God the upper hand in every walking, in every paſſage of your life give God the upper hand; do not aſcribe to your ſelves, lift up the name of God, be content that he ſhould be exalted, and you debaſed, <hi>Not to us Lord, not to us Lord;</hi>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:42593:143"/> put away with both hands, give us nothing, nothing belongs to us, but all belongs to God, glory belongs to God; why, if you be enabled to do for God, if you be enabled to ſuffer for God, give nothing to your ſelves, give him the glory, put it away from you, deſire him to take it all, and aſcribe nothing to your ſelves, but what he is pleaſed to give in freely unto you, oh give him the preheminence in all, and his Son the preheminence in all things; be content that the day of the Lord ſhould be upon whatſoever is high and lifted up; upon all the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and upon all the Oaks of <hi>Baſhan;</hi> upon whatſoever is in your hearts and ſpirits: deſire him to pull down all high thoughts, and to lay you low at his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool; be content that you and all creatures may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, and the Lord alone may be exalted through his ſon Jeſus Chriſt; it ſhould be a Chriſtians care in all things, I ſay, to give God the upper-hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Again, Thirdly, Take heed you do not take up where God doth not take up; do not you ſit down where God ſits not down, for you may haply loſe him, God may go out of ſight, and you may run hard before you can find God again; don't take up in your ſelves, don't take up in creatures, don't ſay here I'le reſt, here I'le take up, don't ſet up here, and ſay, here I'le reſt and take up in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if you will take up in creatures, and reſt in them, where God doth not reſt, why God reſts in himſelf, and wholly in himſelf for ever: he reſts in himſelf, and he reſts in his ſon, <hi>This is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and complacency of the ſoul of the Father is in the perſon of the ſon, <hi>This is my Beloved Son;</hi> Oh, take heed of creatures that your comforts be not ſnares to you, don't take up in them, follow on after
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42593:144"/> the Lord, let your ſpirits take up no where but in God himſelf, and in Chriſt, whom he hath given to be the center of your ſouls, and a foundation for you to build upon for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Again, Fourthly, Entertain ſweet enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between God and your ſouls, I ſay, this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that ſweet entercourſe with God may be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by you, let God be often thought of by you; will you go with a friend and travel with him, and ſpeak not to him? Oh, you will ſpeak often to him: you that walk with God, ſpeak often to God, keep up that entercourſe betwixt God and your ſouls liſten to what God ſpeaks to you; a great deal is loſt becauſe we don't hearken to him, the ſoul is not intent, the ear is not bored to hear what God ſpeaks, therefore many a ſweet word, and many a comfortable word is loſt, becauſe the ſoul don't liſten after God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you Brethren, know it is your duty all the time you are walking with God, it is your duty to hear what God ſpeaks; let your ſoul be attentive unto the Lord, that ſo you may hear every word, whether it be a word of counſel or a word of direction, or a word of conſolation: be ye alwaies either ſpeaking to the Lord, or elſe hearkening to hear what the Lord ſhall ſpeak unto you; this becomes thoſe that have given up themſelves to walk with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 5. Fifthly, And to ſay no more, Take heed of thoſe rubs and lets that are in the way: take heed of that which may hinder, of that which may take you off from walking with God; there's many a ſnare, there's many a rub in the way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Take heed of this preſent evil world; it's a ſnare, it's a bait that draws many off from walking with God, <hi>Demas hath forſaken me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, he hath forſaken me for this preſent evil
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42593:144"/> world,</hi> the Devil catcht him with this bait: Oh, take heed of the ſnares of the world, the cares of the world, the honours of the world, the riches of the world, the pleaſures of the world, theſe are ſnares, I ſay, in which many are taken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Take heed ye turn not out into any way of ſin whatſoever, give no countenance to any evil way in your ſpirits or in your courſes; the God that you walk with, he <hi>is a God of pure eyes,</hi> he can't endure to walk in the defiled waies; if you will walk in the dirt, you ſhall not have God to go along with you, God can't endure to walk in waies of impurity, and therefore, oh, deſire the Lord to make you watchful over the waies of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and over the waies of your converſation, that ſo you may not turn aſide to thoſe defiled waies in which God takes no pleaſure to abide in. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Take heed of an unbelieving heart, which is another ſnare, and is the cauſe of many departings from God, <hi>An evil heart of unbelief;</hi> and therefore don't give way unto it, don't cloſe with it, don't take part with unbelief againſt the work of God in your own ſpirits, for if you take part with Satan againſt the Lord, what a grief will it be unto the Lord, to whom you have given up your ſelves to walk with him? Oh, that the Lord would make you that are his people, watchful over your ſouls! you have given up your ſelves, and therefore take heed you don't turn aſide; maintain this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, deſire that it may be upheld betwixt God and your ſouls: and remember this,</p>
            <p>That it's your greateſt priviledge whilſt you are upon earth, that you may thus walk with God, a mighty priviledge that poor duſt and aſhes, poor worms ſhould be taken to walk with the great
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42593:145"/> God; that God ſhould make choice to have ſuch for his Companions, his Fellow-travellers; Oh, it is infinite rich and Free-grace, therefore do not ſlight it, do not contemn it, but labour to walk up to ſuch relation; it's your dignity, and your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to walk with God. So much for this time, and for this part of the Text.</p>

            <p>YOU have heard of <hi>Enoch's walking,</hi> here's <hi>Enoch's Reſt:</hi> here's recorded what befell him at the end of his Journey, he went a ſtep out of ſight, <hi>He walked with God, and he was not, God took him: He was not,</hi> the phraſe is ſometimes applied unto thoſe whom God takes away by ordinary death; ſo ſaies <hi>Jacob</hi> of his ſons, whom he ſuppoſed to be dead, in <hi>Gen. 42. 36. Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not:</hi> and ſo in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15. you ſhall ſee this phraſe applied to thoſe that God takes away by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, a voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Children, and refuſed to be comforted, becauſe her Children they were not:</hi> and ſo ſome do conceive that <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken away, as other men are, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e it's <hi>appointed for all men once to die;</hi> but the Apoſtle muſt be our Interpreter: he tells us the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that phraſe, as applied to <hi>Enoch, He was not, for God took him;</hi> in <hi>Heb 11. 5. By Faith Enoch
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42593:146"/> was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him: he was not found,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for God had tranſlated him,</hi> he was not found amongſt men, he was no longer of this world, nor in this world, he was taken into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, into another place, for <hi>God had tranſlated him,</hi> and he was not found, and it was not in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way as other men: he was tranſlated, God took him. And ſo it may be ſaid, God takes and receives all the ſpirits of his ſervants: but <hi>Enoch</hi>'s departure, his farewel to the world, was in an extraordinary way, God did not take him as he takes others of his ſervants by death, but God took him from death, he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>that he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. There are many particulars that may be uſeful to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to the main, concerning <hi>Enoch,</hi> which we ſhall hardly reach at this time.</p>
            <p>But to Conſider that phraſe, <hi>He was not.</hi> He was not in the world, of the world; you muſt not think that <hi>Enoch</hi> ceaſed to be, he did not loſe his Being: the Text ſaies, <hi>He was not,</hi> neither do any of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God loſe their Being when they are tranſlated, when taken away by death, but he had no being as to the things of this world, he had a being as to God and Heaven, and as to an inviſible world, ſo he was; and ſo it may be ſaid of all Gods people that leave this world, <hi>They are not,</hi> they are not as to the world; they have no being as to their comforts, relations, friends, employments, and callings; ſo they are not; but as to God, Chriſt, and Heaven, and to the things of an inviſible world, their being is not loſt but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; they have no being as to their relations, death cuts that aſunder. You ſhall ſee what <hi>Job</hi> ſaies, <hi>Job</hi> 7. he complains there, that all relations ceaſe there, and the Servant is free from the Maſter; as this relation,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42593:146"/> ſo all other relations when death comes, ſo that a man he is not, he is no longer as to his friends and relations. And ſo he is as to the comforts of this world, ſee <hi>Job 7. 9. As the Cloud is conſumed and vaniſheth away, ſo he that goeth down to the grave ſhall come up no more:</hi> he ſhall return no more to ſee his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him more, he is conſumed like a Cloud, and gone down to the Grave; and what, hath he no being? No, he ſpeaks only in relation to the things here, and to the comforts and enjoyments, as to his houſe, and ſo to all other comforts of his, he ſhall not return to his houſe, neither ſhall his comforts know him any more. Take notice of this, it will hold forth ſomething that is uſeful to us: It will teach you three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, It will teach Chriſtians to mind the things of God and Heaven more, to be more taken up with the things of the world that is to come; why, as to all the things of this life, as to all your friends, comforts, relations, houſe and land, and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, you ſhall not be e're long, and therefore ſeek more after the things of God and Chriſt, where you ſhall have a being to eternity. Think upon this, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when you are ready to loſe God in the World, when you ſleep over head and ears in your worldly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; Oh, think of this, the time is a coming, the time is at hand when it ſhall be ſaid, That you are no more of the world, and you ſhall have no being at all as to the things of the world, your friends ſhall know you no more, and your relations, your comforts, your houſe ſhall know you no more, you ſhall be to all theſe things as if you had not been, as if you had no being, or as if you had no relation to them; Oh, then whilſt you are in the world don't live as thoſe that are of the world, but ſay as Chriſt did, <hi>Now, Father,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42593:147"/> I am no more of this world;</hi> live more there where your being ſhall be to eternity: Live more upon God and Chriſt, and be more exerciſed in the contemplation of the things of the inviſible world, there your being ſhall be to eternity; and don't live ſo much upon thoſe poor low outward things, where you ſhall have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing e're long; but when the world ſhall ſpeak of you, they ſhall ſay, You are not, even as it was of <hi>Enoch</hi> here, <hi>Enoch</hi> was not, as to this world he was not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, This may alſo inſtruct you how to carry it towards the loſs of friends and relations: when God ſhall take away any of your friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, take heed you don't let out natural affections towards them when God hath taken them, for they are not, as to you they are not, they are none of yours, you have no relation to them, death hath broken it, they were given you for a time, your Husband, your Wife, your Children, they were given you for a time, to be comforts to you for a time, till the Lord ſhould call for them; but when the Lord hath taken them, they are no longer yours, they are not, as to you: It's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then to let out natural affections towards them, as to look upon them as yours, your Husband, your Wife, your Children, they are not as to you, but they are as to the Lord, compleat in him, and as to you they are not: and therefore it's ſinful unto you, to let out natural affections, when God hath broken your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, This may give ſome comfort in the loſs of friends, when they die in the Lord; they are not loſt, they don't ceaſe to be: If they were annihilated and deſtroyed, and if they had no being any where, there's cauſe to mourn, there's a loſs indeed; they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappear unto you, and unto this viſible world, but they are not loſt, they appear in the preſence of God,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42593:147"/> though you ſee them not, and they have no being as to you, yet as to God in heaven, in another world, they have a being, a glorious being, a perfect being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cauſe why we ſhould mourn for them as if they were utterly loſt. That's the firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Enoch</hi> was not, as to this world, and as to the relations of this life he was not. But again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Obſerve how eaſily <hi>Enoch</hi> was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, how eaſie God makes <hi>Enoch</hi>'s paſſage to another world; he walks with God, and God took him, and we hear no more of him: he walked all his life with God, and at the end of his courſe God took him along with him; it's ſpoken of him as if he went but a ſtep further, and he was not here, he went but a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he went along with God, God took him to himſelf. We may obſerve that God can make the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his ſervants eaſie to another world: ſuch as walk with God on earth, God makes their paſſage eaſie to another world, ſo it was with <hi>Enoch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is it ſo to others, <hi>Enoch</hi>'s tranſlation was eaſie, for <hi>Enoch,</hi> he was not diſſolved, ſoul and body did not part, but both were taken up to live with God, but is it ſo to others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, God can and doth make it ſo unto his people that walk with him: though death may ſeem a ſtrait paſſage, and a dark entry, yet the Lord can make it lightſome, he can make it eaſie unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: what an eaſie matter was it for <hi>Moſes</hi> to die, when he had walked with God all his life? It was ſpoken of him as an ordinary thing, <hi>Go up and die,</hi> God bid him go up upon the Mount and die there, go and die there, and <hi>Moſes</hi> went up and God made that death eaſie to him: And ſo it was ſpoken of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, and thoſe that walked with God in thoſe old Ages, God made this ſtrait paſſage eaſie to them,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42593:148"/> therefore it's called a falling aſleep, after they had ſerved their Generation <hi>they fell aſleep;</hi> or they were <hi>gathered up to their Fathers;</hi> it's ſet forth by ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; <hi>Jacob</hi> leaned upon his ſtaff and raiſed up himſelf and bleſſed his Children, and ſpeaking of the things of God and Heaven, and ſo he fell aſleep; God makes it eaſie unto them that walk with him, for they that walk with God gain experiences of him, I ſay, they that walk with God treaſure up experiences of Gods gracious dealings, they ſhall ſee how God hath been with them many a time: he hath been with them in many deaths, he hath been with them in the fire, he hath been with them in the water, he hath been with them in many Jeopardies and dark conditions, he hath delivered them: they have gained many experiences of God, therefore they will truſt in God, they'l truſt in him when they walk through the Valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, he is a ſure friend, he is a tried friend, and therefore they can't but reſt in him. But,</p>
            <p>Again, They that walk with God walk by Faith, now it's faith makes death eaſie: all thoſe Worthies ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. died willingly, for they died in Faith, Faith makes the ſtrait paſſage eaſie, For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Faith diſcovers the Victory of Chriſt, I ſay, it makes diſcovery of the victory of Chriſt over death and the Grave, preſents the Saviour that is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, that hath diſarmed the ſtrong man, that hath taken away the ſting of the Serpent: now when the ſoul by Faith ſees that death is diſarmed, and the ſting is taken out, it's eaſie then to grapple with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, Faith takes hold of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are grounded upon the faithfulneſs and truth of God for its ſecurity, I ſay, it takes hold of thoſe promiſes which are made in faithfulneſs and truth: why, the Lord hath ſaid that he will be with his people in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42593:148"/> all their ſtraits, yea, when they walk through the valley and ſhadow of death, that he will never leave them, he will never forſake them; now the diſcovery of this to the ſoul makes death eaſie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, Faith looks beyond death, it's higher, it's taller than death, it can look over the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of death, it hath a piercing eye, it can ſee through the darkneſs of the Grave, and it can behold the tops of the Towers of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it can ſee the Land that lies beyond the Land of death, it ſees the dark entry and the low valley that doth over-ſhadow it, it doth lead unto that Land, that Land of bleſſedneſs that the Lord hath prepared for his people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whilſt faith is thus exerciſed, death is made eaſie, and they that walk with God walk and live by faith, and therefore to them is death made eaſie. Yea,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Again, Death is made eaſie to them, for by walking with God they have gained acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and it's acquaintance with God that makes death eaſie: when a ſoul hath walked with God as with his friend all his life, it's not afraid to go to God at laſt, becauſe he is his friend; he knows God thoroughly, and therefore can truſt him, he knows his gracious diſpoſition, and the love that is in his heart, <hi>He that comes to God muſt believe that he is,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, and that <hi>He is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> till this grace of the love of God be diſcovered, the ſoul can't come to him on earth, it can't draw nigh to him by faith, much leſs can he come freely to him in heaven. Why this is the cauſe why death is ſo terrible, becauſe his acquaintance is no more with God; but when the ſoul hath lived as in heaven, and converſed with God, and beheld his face, and follows him continually with this acquaintance he hath gained with God, it doth make the paſſage of death (though
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42593:149"/> ſtrait in it ſelf, yet) eaſie: And therefore to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. I beſeech you, you that walk with God, that you would not be diſcouraged through the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtraitneſs of this paſſage: you know not how eaſie God can make it, why ſhould you diſtruſt him? do not fear the greatneſs of the pains, God can make them eaſie, God can allay them, God can take away the ſenſe of them, God can give in that which can ſweeten them; remember who went before you, hath not the Lord Jeſus gone before you? He ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the fore-front of the Battel, the paſſage was a great deal ſtraiter when Chriſt went through it, he hath widened it and made it far more eaſie: Believers, you have ſeen the worſt that death can do to you, you have ſeen it in Chriſt, if it had overcome Chriſt you might have fear'd it, but Chriſt would try the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt upon himſelf, and you have ſeen the worſt that it can do; Jeſus Chriſt is engaged with you, if you ſhould periſh, Chriſt himſelf had as good have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; it's all one whether he be overcome in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in his members; Oh, therefore, I ſay, be not diſcouraged at the apprehenſion of the ſtraitneſs of the paſſage, and darkneſs of the entry, but look to Chriſt that hath gone before you, and only let it be your care whilſt you live, to live by Faith, and to live in conſtant communion with God, God will take care of the reſt: And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Again, How ſhould you bleſs the Lord Chriſt! What cauſe have you to bleſs the Lord, and to admire the riches of wiſdom, and the riches of power, and the riches of goodneſs that hath made death to be thus eaſie? I tell you, it is not ſo in it ſelf: Chriſtians, you are beholding to Chriſt for this, death is not eaſie in it ſelf, it is moſt terrible in it ſelf, it hath
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42593:149"/> brought down mighty ſpirits of wicked men; Oh! whither ſhall I go, ſaid <hi>Nero?</hi> when death was at hand: It was not ſo eaſie with Chriſt; oh, it was exceeding ſtrait when he ventured to paſs through, it was for your ſakes that he entred the paſſage firſt: Oh! admire his wiſdom, goodneſs and power, and bleſs his name for this both in life and death. That's a ſecond thing we conſidered, <hi>Enoch was not, God took him:</hi> his tranſlation is ſpoken of him as a very eaſie thing, he walked a ſtep further, and returned no more, <hi>and God took him.</hi> There is one Particular more which I ſhall give but a hint on, and that is, <hi>He was not found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſaies the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Heb. 11. 5. He was not found, for God had tranſlated him; He was not found,</hi> and that implies, he was ſought for when God had took him, <hi>They ſought for him, but he was not found,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle: And ſo it was with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. latter end of the Chapter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſends out fifty men to ſeek after him; and it's very like they did ſo for <hi>Enoch,</hi> but he was not found, for God took him.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, It is uſual to undervalue mercies whilſt we have them, which are prized dearly when once they are gone; I ſay, it is uſual with the ſons of men to undervalue mercies whilſt they have them, which they would ſeek for when once they are gone: thus we deal with perſons, and thus we deal with other mercies; With Perſons, you know how <hi>Samuel</hi> was undervalued by <hi>Saul</hi> whilſt he lived, and the Word of the Lord that he brought to <hi>Saul</hi> was rejected; but when <hi>Samuel</hi> was gone, then <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeks for him; nay, he was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that he ſeeks him in an unlawful way, even to raiſe him up from the dead, that he might acquaint him with the Will of the Lord. And ſo <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and baniſhed, and <hi>Herod</hi> cut off his head, but
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42593:150"/> when he was gone, then <hi>Herod</hi> prized him; and ſo when <hi>Herod</hi> heard of the fame of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that he did great things, <hi>Surely it is John Baptiſt that is riſen up again:</hi> here's mighty works indeed: And thus we deal not only with <hi>Perſons,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thus we deal with other <hi>Mercies,</hi> whilſt we have them, we undervalue them, that God is forced to take them away, to let us know what the worth of them is: <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not prize her mercies, outward Mercies, Corn, Wine and Oyl, Flax and Wool, and therefore God was forced to take them away, to let them know the worth of them, <hi>I will take away my Corn, my Wine and my Oyl, my Flax and my Wool,</hi> Hoſ. 4. Yea, thus we deal with God himſelf, thus we deal with God and Chriſt, and with the great and precious things of God; how did <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpiſe his birth-right, how contemptibly did he ſpeak of it, whilſt he had it? <hi>What will my birth-right do me good,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ſeeing I am ready to die?</hi> And yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when it was gone he ſought it with tears, when <hi>Jacob</hi> had got the bleſſing he ſought it with tears, and he could not obtain it. Yea, this is not only in the hearts of the wicked; if it were only in the wicked it were the leſs: but it is in the hearts of Gods own people to undervalue the things of God, whilſt they enjoy them, and ſo give the Lord cauſe to ſtrip them of them. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had the preſence of God amongſt them, but they did not prize God, and therefore ſaies God, <hi>I will go and return to my firſt place; in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> Thus we deal with other of Gods precious ones, many times they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, and we know not the worth of them, till ſuch time as they are removed, till God takes them away: As it is ſaid concerning the Jews in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. that Chriſt was amongſt them, and Preached the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42593:150"/> Goſpel to them, and they received it not: But when the Goſpel was removed from them, then they prized it, <hi>Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate:</hi> Why? in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. there you have the ſame words, when the Children cried, ſaying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna, Hoſanna to the Higheſt,</hi> the Jews were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; when the people ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and bleſſed is he that comes in the Name of the Lord;</hi> they were offended in the 15 Verſe, and Chriſt doth rebuke them for this, Well, ſaies he, (when they cried, <hi>Hoſanna, bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord</hi>) you are diſpleaſed, the time is a coming, that you would give all that you enjoy, to ſee ſuch a man as you have ſeen, but I will teach you by the abſence of this mercy, of which you ſhall ſay, Welcom indeed, and <hi>bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord:</hi> I ſay, what baſe hearts and ſpirits are within us, that we ſhould put God unto this labour, that we ſhould cauſe God to walk in this way towards us, to take away our mercies, that we may know how to prize them! Oh, it is an unworthy heart, there is a great deal of the ſpirit of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to deſpiſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing whilſt we had it, and then afterwards weep for it, and ſought it with tears, but found it not. And therefore I ſhall conclude with this word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let us learn to prize our mercies, I ſay, whilſt we enjoy our mercies, let us learn to prize them, becauſe the time is coming when they ſhall not be to us, they ſhall not be found, we ſhall ſeek them, and ſhall not find them: God hath given you friends and relations; Oh, my Brethren, prize them, uſe them for Gods glory, do all the good you can to them whilſt you have them, receive all the good
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42593:151"/> that may be from them whilſt you have them, for the time is a coming when they ſhall not be to you. It was <hi>Job</hi>'s argument with God, you ſhall ſee in <hi>Job</hi> 7. the laſt Verſe, and it is a very ſtrong argument, and <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and take away my iniquity, and pardon it quickly?</hi> Speak a good word quickly to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I cannot hold out long, Lord, ſaies he, I cannot hold out long, now I ſhall ſleep in the duſt, and thou ſhalt ſeek me in the morning, and I ſhall not be: Lord pardon, pardon thy ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> whilſt thou haſt a <hi>Job</hi> to pardon, Lord, do good to me whilſt thou haſt an occaſion to do good to me, e're I ſleep in the duſt: you ſhall ſeek me then, and I ſhall not be: that you ſhall ſay, oh that I had ſuch a friend to do good to, or that I had ſuch a friend to receive good from: Oh, take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity therefore of doing and receiving good; and this is ſpoken not only of all <hi>Perſons</hi> but of all <hi>Things,</hi> prize them whilſt you have them, prize them whilſt you enjoy them, for time is coming when they ſhall not be.</p>
            <p>And Conſider this, Let me ſay this to you, The Lord is this day tendering grace to you, he ſtands, he knocks, he invites you, he beſeeches you, he deſires you to open, he is willing to pardon mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of tranſgreſſions, to waſh away thouſands, and ten thouſands of tranſgreſſions and ſins, and to ſubdue them alſo; Oh, that the Lord would give you hearts to ſeek after this preſent mercy, you'l ſeek them hereafter when they ſhall not be; Oh, take heed leſt Chriſt ſpeak to you as he ſpake to the Jews, which was a fearful ſentence, becauſe of their miſtaking their time, and neglecting their opportunity, <hi>Joh. 7. 34. You ſhall ſeek me,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>and ſhall not find me,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42593:151"/> and where I am, you cannot come:</hi> he had ſaid a little before, <hi>And I am with you, and am coming to them that ſeek me;</hi> and afterward, <hi>You ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find me;</hi> Chriſt was with them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while preaching and holding forth, and urging mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace, beſeeching of them to come in, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and reject life, Well, ſaies Chriſt, I have ſought you, and you would not be found; you would not follow me; the time is coming when you ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find me, and where I am you cannot come; and you that fear the Lord,</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, be you warned alſo, take heed you don't ſlight your mercies, your preſent enjoyments of God, leſt the Lord alſo teach you to know the worth by the want; I ſay, take heed that you do not abuſe your mercies, take heed that you do not grow cold, and dead, and looſe, and formal, under the enjoyment of the means of getting nigher God, which you enjoy more than formerly, for what pity is it that we ſhould grow worſe when God is better? That we ſhould be further off from drawing nigh to God, when God is drawing nigh to us? What pity is it that the Sun-ſhine and fair weather ſhould do harm? Doth not ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teach us that many Chriſtians are further off from God now than when the means were leſſer, in their getting near to God; take heed God don't let you know by ſad experience what the loſs of his preſence is, and that he don't let you know by ſad experience what the loſs of Ordinances are, what the want of mercies are; it ſhews abundance of corruption that is in the heart, but it is mercy if God will teach his people any way; it is the ſaddeſt way of teaching that God will make uſe of, to recount what once we had, and what once we enjoyed, and now are ſtript of, for want of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: we had the Sabbaths, the teachings of God, we
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42593:152"/> had the Ordinances, but now ſtript of all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may (as they) ſit down by the waters of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and weep moſt bitterly; it is a ſad way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it is mercy if God will chooſe any way of teaching and drawing theſe ſad and drowſie hearts of ours more to himſelf. Thus you have had ſome hints of what <hi>Enoch</hi> was, <hi>He was not found, for God had tranſlated him, God took him;</hi> the main Point is yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi> to conſider whither <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, and wherefore he was tranſlated, and the year in which he was tranſlated, which was three hundred ſixty five years, and was the ſhorteſt life of all the Patriarchs. But ſo much ſhall ſerve for this time.</p>

            <p>WE have done with <hi>Enoch</hi>'s walk, we are come to <hi>Enoch</hi>'s <hi>Reſt, He was not, for God took him;</hi> I have opened the phraſe to you the laſt time I ſpake. But I ſhall proceed to what is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was not, for God took him,</hi> And God took him: there is a great diſpute amongſt many, to what <hi>place Enoch</hi> was taken. There are many both of the Papiſts and others that place <hi>Enoch</hi> in earthly Paradiſe: they ſay <hi>Enoch</hi> was not taken into Heaven but into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and that this <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> are thoſe two Witneſſes that ſhall come again at the end of the world to diſcover and deſtroy Antichriſt; there is ſuch a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition generally amongſt them, and others have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from them; but there is not the leaſt ground for it in the Word of God, that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhould be thoſe Witneſſes ſpoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. for certainly thoſe Witneſſes are no other but the ſervants
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42593:153"/> of God ſpoken of, that have ſtood up in all Ages ſince Chriſt, to bear witneſs to the name and truth of Jeſus; and therefore I ſee nothing why we may not aſſert, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken up into Heaven, that he aſcended in body into Heaven. You ſhall ſee in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 11. it is ſpoken there of <hi>Elijah</hi> who was tranſlated even as <hi>Enoch, And it came to paſs as they ſtill went on, and talked, that behold (there appeared) a Chariot of fire, and Horſes of fire, and parted them both aſunder, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven:</hi> if <hi>Elijah</hi> went into Heaven, why not <hi>Enoch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be Objected, Is not Jeſus Chriſt the firſt-fruits of them that aſcend? Did not Chriſt open the door by his blood? How then could <hi>Enoch</hi> or <hi>Elijah</hi> aſcend into Heaven before Chriſt came and opened the door?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer, It is true that Chriſt is the firſt-fruits of them that aſcend, and the way to Heaven is ſet open by the blood of Chriſt, and there was none ever aſcended but by vertue of the blood of Chriſt, that ſets open the door to them; but the efficacy of the blood of Chriſt did reach to them that lived before him; and therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. he is called <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the foundations of the World,</hi> in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God; yea, it was accepted of God as if done already; God the Father took the Word of his Son for the payment of the Debt, he knew that he was able to make good his word, and would be faithful to him, wherefore he truſted him before he diſcharged the Debt, before the price was actually paid, ſo that the vertue of Chriſts blood did even reach to them, even many thouſand years before he came in the fleſh to ſuffer: for the Father took his word, and the ſon took the Fathers word for the ſalvation of thoſe that ſhould be brought in many hundred years after the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42593:153"/> debt was paid; the ſalvation of all that belong to God, who ſhould live from Chriſts time to the end of the world: the ſon gave the full price into the fathers hand, and he relies upon him, upon his word for the diſcharge of the debt, and for the receiving of poor ſinners to life and favour, as they ſhall be brought in in all Ages; and therefore, Dear Brethren, I beſeech you, take notice of the mighty vertue of the death of Chriſt, mighty vertue was in it, that he ſhould be accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that it ſhould reach as far as <hi>Enoch,</hi> as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> that it ſhould be accepted for thoſe that lived many thouſand years before Chriſt, before the debt was paid, it holds forth the mighty efficacy of the blood of Chriſt; if it had been only available for thoſe that had lived after him, after Chriſt was come in the fleſh, and dead and riſen, and had diſcharged the debt, if it had reach'd only to thoſe, it had not been ſo much: it is not ſo much, ſaies <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> for the ſhadow to go forward in the Dial, but for the ſhadow to go backward ſo many degrees, that holds forth a deal of the mighty power of God to his conviction; and ſo the blood of Chriſt goes backward ſo many years to them that lived in the beginning of the world, before the price was actually paid: O the infinite vertue and efficacy that is in this blood of Chriſt! Oh, know what ſtrong ground of conſolation there is in this, to you that are Believers now under the Goſpel: if it reach'd ſo far, if it went backward, if it went as far as <hi>Enoch,</hi> to open the gate of Heaven to him, how much more ſhall this reach you that are believers under the Goſpel, that live directly under the efficacy of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. God bad <hi>Enoch</hi> welcom for this blood that was to be ſhed; if he ſet the door open to him, when the price was not actually paid, oh how much more ſhall God bid the Saints welcom, to come in the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42593:154"/> name of ſuch a Saviour that was dead, is riſen and aſcended, now to ſit at the right-hand of God, and preſent the efficacy of his blood for ever? Oh! how may this be improved, and what ſweet lives might Chriſtians lead, and with what a full wind might they fail, and lanch forth into the Ocean of Eternity, when they live directly under the efficacy of ſuch a blood as this is, that reach'd ſo far backward, even as far as <hi>Enoch?</hi> for it was by vertue of this blood that <hi>Enoch</hi> was ſaved.</p>
            <p>But further, It's ſaid, <hi>God took him:</hi> That phraſe implies three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, That <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken up into a ſtate of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> of near Communion with God, <hi>God took him;</hi> God took him to himſelf. He had walked with God whilſt he was upon earth, but he was not taken up into neareſt Communion until now; the Saints in heaven are taken into higheſt Communion; their Communion here upon earth is interrupted many times, God comes now and then and gives a poor ſoul a viſit, but they are not taken in into God till ſuch time as God removes the Mount of this viſible world: they are here put out to School, God will give them good education, he will bring them up for heaven; and therefore it is not alwaies that they have their Fathers preſence, now and then God comes and viſits them: but there is another life in which God ſhall take his people to himſelf, he ſhall ſend for his Children home, and then they ſhall be for ever with the Lord, I ſay, for ever with the Lord; <hi>Whilſt we are here,</hi> ſaies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>we are abſent from the Lord; Whilſt we are in the body, we are abſent from the Lord</hi> and therefore no wonder why the Saints are breathing ſo much after that other life, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooking for, and haſtning after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are not taken in till then, here they are ſtrangers, and here they are abſent from
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:42593:154"/> the Lord in a great meaſure, though they walk with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, yet he will not take them into that neareſt Communion, till they come to end this life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But again, Secondly, As it doth denote a ſtate of near Communion which the Saints enjoy in heaven, ſo it doth hold forth that fulneſs of light, life and glory that the Saints ſhall there enjoy: <hi>God took him,</hi> he was taken into God, taken up to the enjoyment of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in God; here they are narrow veſſels, and are not capable of receiving much, but there the ſouls of his Saints ſhall be taken into God, and ſo ſhall be filled with his fulneſs. Believers here walk with God, and God doth dwell in them, but ſo long as they dwell below, they don't dwell ſo much in God: but there is a time a coming when they ſhall dwell wholly in God, they ſhall be taken up into that fulneſs; they ſhall be as ſo many veſſels that are caſt into the Ocean that ſhall be filled; every one ſhall be filled full to the brim: I ſay, this holds forth that phraſe of fulneſs of glory that the Saints do enjoy in Heaven, <hi>God took him,</hi> and he was taken into God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, It holds forth an act of free grace which was put forth towards <hi>Enoch</hi> as well as others: <hi>God took him,</hi> or received him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it holds forth the free grace of God; <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> but he was not taken for his walking, not becauſe he had walked ſo and ſo with God in his Generation, he was not therefore taken, but he was received; it was free-grace received him: My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I beſeech you then know, what you can only plead before God, though you have walked with God never ſo long in your Generation, yet you can't at laſt plead to be taken up becauſe you have walked with God; Alas! the Lord ſees ſo many ſlips, ſo many ſtumblings, ſo many falls, there's ſo much crookedneſs in the way
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42593:155"/> of the heart, in the way of the converſation, even in the beſt of Saints, that if the Lord ſhould judge them according to their walkings, they were undone: thoſe Hypocrites plead a great deal, when they cried, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils, and done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and yet Chriſt bids them depart for he knew them not; there is no pleading of works, there is no pleading of worthineſs, and of the creatures righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, when the creature comes to ſtand before Chriſt; if you could walk with God as many years as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, yet at the end of your walk, at the end of your courſe, you muſt lay down all, and be willing to enter in as ſinners, that is, at the door of free-grace, not through any door of your own works or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And again, How does this call upon the people of God to be exceeding careful to receive Chriſt? Oh! receive him freely, he receives you freely here, and he will receive you freely hereafter: how are you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to receive him freely, to cloſe fully with him, and with the tenders of life and grace, of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, which are held forth in and through him? Receive Chriſt freely, and receive the Word of Chriſt freely, though it be never ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, though it croſſes your beloved luſts, though it croſs your profits, though it croſs your delights, though it be the Word and Truth for which you muſt ſuffer; yet, oh why ſhould not you receive Chriſt and his Word freely, ſeeing he will receive you ſo freely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day? He won't be aſhamed to take his people and to own them before all the world, theſe are mine, my Jewels: and if Chriſt won't be aſhamed of you, oh what a ſhame is it that you ſhould either be aſhamed or afraid to receive him and his Word, and his Truth, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42593:155"/> to hold it forth in a time of oppoſition and ſuffering The free-grace of God in receiving his people at laſt, is a mighty engagement unto them, now to receive Chriſt, and every word of Chriſt, whilſt they are in this Pilgrimage, where God hath ſet them to bear up his name in the world. But,</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>God took Enoch:</hi> When was <hi>Enoch</hi> taken? When he had lived three hundred ſixty and five years, that you find in the Chapter to be the term of his life, three hundred ſixty and five years: if you compare the years of <hi>Enoch</hi> with the years of others, of the holy men that lived in that Generation, you ſhall find his life exceeding ſhort; his father lived above nine hundred and ſixty years, and his ſon <hi>Mathuſalem</hi> lived longer; yea, all the time of all the Patriarchs (there) in this Chapter, even amongſt them all, <hi>Enoch</hi> was the ſhorteſt liver: a holy man, a gracious man, and one that was moſt eminent in his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and none there was that walked with God in his Generation as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, and yet <hi>Enoch</hi>'s daies are ſhortened; I ſay, ſometimes the Lord ſhortens the daies of his Children, that have walked and lived with him in an abundance of love and mercy.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, What time is that? and when is it a mercy? When does God ſhorten the daies of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in love?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, God hath ſome of his ſervants that lie under great preſſures, their combatings are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and ſometimes he ſhortens the term of their life in mercy and love. We ſhall conſider thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular combats which ſome of the Lords people are in an extraordinary manner exerciſed with, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in pity, mercy and love the Lord ſhortens their daies on earth. As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:42593:156"/>1. Firſt, There is ſome of Gods ſervants that have extraordinary warrings with corruptions within them, I ſay, with corruptions within them, and this proves a moſt heavy burden to them, and makes their very lives uncomfortable, a continual burden to them: Oh, theſe daughters of <hi>Heth</hi> were a continual vexation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rebecca;</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a man able to bear much, and he bore a great deal of affliction which he met withal in his Pilgrim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge, that he could rejoice in afflictions, and glory in tribulations, they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him: but when he comes to combate with ſin, luſt and corruption that was within him, he was forc'd to cry out, to cry out for help; he could rejoice in other affliction, but herein he could not rejoice, <hi>O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> I ſay, ſome have extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings with corruption more than others; Oh theſe Monſters! as ſoon as one head is cut off another ſprings up in the room, never at peace, the war is never at an end: the Lord ſhortens their warfare in that.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, God hath ſome of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that are extraordinarily imployed with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; oh they are hunted up and down, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baited, baited with Satans moſt horrible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: winds and ſtorms are ever beating, fiery darts are ever thrown in; before one wound is healed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is given: Well, the Lord looks out from Heaven, he looks down, he ſees the combate, and many times he makes this the way of deliverance, he puts out his hand, he takes his poor ſervants to himſelf, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them from the baitings of Satans temptations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, Some of Gods ſervants are in extraordinary afflictions all their daies, above all the men in the world they are moſt afflicted; I ſay, the way that God leads ſome of his ſervants to heaven, is a
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42593:156"/> very dark and narrow lane, and they ſee more afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than all their Neighbours: in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am.</hi> 3 1. well ſaies the Prophet there, <hi>I am the man that have ſeen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; I am the man that have ſeen affliction,</hi> that's no great matter, who hath not ſeen affliction? Is that ſuch a matter for the Prophet to complain of, that he had ſeen affliction? Ay, but his portion was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, he had ſeen more than all others in his time, and therefore complains as if he alone had been the man that had ſeen affliction; Well, when afflictions are very great and of long continuance, God hath trained up ſome of his ſervants in this way in this School; yea, he many times ſhortens their journey in love. But you will ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Could not God deliver them ſome other way? Could not God reſcue them out of the hands of affliction, and deliver them from temptation, and make them conquerours over their luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But muſt he ſhorten their lives by it, and no other way?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why Beloved, we muſt know this, the Lord ſees it beſt, and he knows it is needful for them to come to him in this narrow way, and they could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe afflictions and warrings of luſts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe temptations, and it's the beſt way, infinite wiſdom ſees it the beſt way to lead them to himſelf, and to glory: And therefore when the caſe is thus, that the Lord ſees it ſo needful, that ſo long as they are in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they ſhould be in theſe conflicts, afflictions, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then the Lord (ſometimes) ſees it beſt to ſhorten ſome of their daies to bring them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But you muſt take this caution: Take heed you don't limit the Lord to this way, for though God doth take many of his ſervants this way by death, yet, I ſay, they ought not to limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:42593:157"/> Let not them ſay as <hi>Job, Wherefore is life given to a man that is in affliction? Wherefore is life given to a man whoſe way is hid?</hi> For if God continues life in afflicted conditions, he ſees good reaſon for it: and therefore, I ſay, you may not abſolutely deſire death becauſe of your affliction, becauſe of your temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe of your buffettings; not abſolutely to limit God in this way of deliverance, for though God doth uſe this way many times, yet he will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to it.</p>
            <p>And though the Lord doth keep you in affliction, he ſees it is for his honour, it is for his own glory; that he may ſhew his power and goodneſs, his wiſdom in directing you, his power in ſupporting you, in ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening you, in delivering you, and in making you able to hold out in ſuch difficult afflicted conditions: the Lord can find many waies of deliverance; therefore don't ſay you, <hi>Lord, take away my life, my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is great,</hi> I ſee no way how I ſhall come out of it; this is ſinful: for God hath many waies, I ſay, God chooſes this way ſometimes to free his people from all their corruption and temptations, he ſhortens their lives, and that in abundance of love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, God ſometimes doth ſhorten the daies of his ſervants in love, when they live in evil times, times in which iniquity doth abound, then God fetches home many of his ſervants in love: It was a very corrupt time that <hi>Enoch</hi> lived in, <hi>The world was corrupt and filled with violence,</hi> and therefore it was in love to <hi>Enoch</hi> that God ſhortened his courſe: the Lord knows how afflictive it is, for his ſervants to live in an evil world, <hi>Wo is me,</hi> ſaies the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that I am conſtrained to ſojourn in Meſech, and to dwell in the Tents of Kedar,</hi> Pſal. 120. 5. That righteous ſoul was vexed, <hi>Wo is me,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, the Lord conſiders
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42593:157"/> that poſſibly his own people may be carried down the ſtream through the ſtrength and violence of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the times, that they may be drawn aſide from their ſtedfaſtneſs, it's poſſible that even they may be corrupted, even Gods own people may be corrupted, in a corrupt Generation: the Lord conſiders this, and therefore many times he takes them away in an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love and mercy. When the Thiſtles and Nettles do ſo incloſe the Lilies, that they hinder their growth, and communicate of their ill favour unto them, then the Lord ſees it's high time to remove, to tranſplant his Lilies into a better ſoil. And that's a ſecond Particular why the Lord doth ſhorten the daies of his ſervants, it is when they live in a very corrupt and ſinful Generation, that doth both afflict them and endanger them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, Sometimes God ſhortens the daies of his ſervants in love; that they may not ſee when great deſolations are coming, either upon their friends, their relations, their families, or upon the Kingdom they live in: the Lord in mercy calls home thoſe that do walk faithfully with him: and thus it was with <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s child in 1 <hi>Kings 14. 13. Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s child was taken away, you have the reaſon given there, becauſe great deſolation is coming upon the Family, God threatens there by the Prophet, that he would not leave one perſon alive, and this child ſhall go to his Grave in peace, <hi>Becauſe ſome good thing was found in him towards the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> ſome good thing was found in him when the family was corrupt, and therefore God would not have him to ſee what deſolation he would bring upon the family: And ſo when God brings deſolation upon Kingdoms and Nations, he ſometimes calls home his own people. Good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a gracious man, was cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42593:158"/> becauſe the Lord was about to bring deſolation upon <hi>Judah:</hi> a great and fearful Captivity which came preſently after, when he was gone; but he feared the Lord, and was fearful when the Word of the Lord came to him, and therefore God took him that he might not ſee that deſolation with his eyes, that ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, that God would bring upon <hi>Judah.</hi> And ſo ſaies the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1. he gives this as a reaſon why God takes away ſome of his ſervants betimes, <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and the merciful man is taken away, none conſidering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come:</hi> When evil and deſolation is about to come upon a place or a Kingdom, why then God takes away many righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and merciful men. The Husbandman, when he ſees a ſtorm is a coming, he makes haſte to gather in his Corn, eſpecially, that which is moſt ready to ſhake, that which is moſt like to take harm by the wet, that he'll in withall: And thus the Lord doth with his, when he ſees great deſolation, that may even ſhake thoſe that are his own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, God takes way ſome of his ſervants that he may prevent their uneven walking, and their declining and turning aſide from him: the Lord loves to take his ſervants when they are at the beſt, he pulls the Roſe when it's moſt ſweet: ſometimes the Lord ſees many of his ſervants, that if they ſhould ſtand longer they would decline and grow worſe; ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth teach it; now therefore it is that the Lord takes them at the fit time, that he may prevent that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, that otherwiſe might be brought to his name, if he ſhould ſuffer them to ſtand longer in the world, they might happily blurr their profeſſion, they might diſhonour God, they might harden their own hearts; and therefore the Lord loves to take them when they
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42593:158"/> are fully ripe: and when he ſees ſuch a one ready to decline and grow worſe, and to loſe of his ſweetneſs, and of his ſavour, it may blurr the name of God, diſhonour him in the world; why, the Lord to prevent all this, takes away ſometimes ſuch a ſervant of his in abundance of love and mercy: and ſo he took away <hi>Aſa,</hi> and ſo <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> they were good men, but they began to decline in their old daies; <hi>Aſa</hi> was a good man, his heart was perfect, it is the Teſtimony that God gives of him, all his daies; but he went and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, he went and relied on the arm of fleſh: when the Prophet tells him of it, he was angry with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he impriſons the Prophet, and he began to ſmite the people, and God ſmites <hi>Aſa</hi> with a diſeaſe in his feet, and ſo took him away; and it was beſt for <hi>Aſa</hi> that he was taken away before a further declining: and ſo <hi>Jehoſapbat</hi> did take part with a wicked King, and the Lord did ſhorten his daies in abundance of love.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fifthly, God will ſhorten the daies of his ſervants, when they are enabled to do much in a little time; when he hath cauſed them to run amain after himſelf, to follow him hard, and ſo through his grace have done the work of their Generation in a little time, then the Lord ſhortens the daies of their dwelling in the body in abundance of love: when their work is done, the ſooner their work is done, the ſooner they are at reſt; the Lord will not keep his people longer from their reſt than needs muſt, he knows that their daies are as the daies of an Hireling, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, full of labour, full of toyl, and full of trouble, full of diſquietneſs and hurryings, no reſt; therefore ſo ſoon as ever they have done their work, God takes them; he loves to have his children bettered, he won't put them to School longer than needs muſt, when he hath trained them up for heaven, he preſently ſends for them
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42593:159"/> home, he hath longing deſires to ſee them: Chriſt would have all his children round about him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he hath cauſed them to do his work in a little time, he will then ſend for them, <hi>That where I am, you may be alſo; I am gone to prepare a place for you, and I will come again and receive you to glory.</hi> It ſhews how the Lord Chriſt doth haſten, he hath longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſee them, I am gone away, and I come again as ſoon as ever the work is done, he will not ſtay a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute when he hath fitted glory for them, and fitted them for glory, <hi>I will come;</hi> I'le come again and take you to my ſelf, he longs for them, and cauſes their hearts alſo to be breathing mightily after him; and therefore they ſhall not be abſent from the Lord longer than needs muſt, but when he hath cauſed them to do the work of their Generation, he will take them away in abundance of love and mercy. There are ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to Anſwer, as concerning long life as a bleſſing, but ſo much for this time.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HE was not, for God took him.</hi> I opened the phraſe to you the laſt day, God took him to Communion with himſelf, to near Communion; the Saints whilſt in the body are at a diſtance from God, <hi>Whilſt we are preſent in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; though God do now and then viſit them, yet for the moſt part they are abſent from God: they are put out to School, and here God will have his people trained up for Heaven, but when that change comes which is ſpoken of, why then, God is ſaid to take them, he takes them home, he takes them into nigheſt fellowſhip and communion with himſelf: <hi>For God took him;</hi> the phraſe holds forth that fulneſs of glory which the Saints are tranſlated out of this world into; God dwells here in them, but they dwell in God; they here are depreſſed in their ſpirits through the weight of corruption; it't but a little they are able to hold of God; Ay, but in Heaven there God takes them, he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42593:160"/> takes them in to himſelf, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter into the joy of thy Maſter, enter into it;</hi> they ſhall be as ſo many veſſels that are caſt into fulneſs of love, life and glory, they ſhall be filled full to the brim: <hi>God took him.</hi> It holds forth alſo the freeneſs of grace in receiving in any; even the beſt muſt enter in at this door of free-grace, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: though <hi>Enoch</hi> had walked with God ſo many years, three hundred ſixty and five, yet it's free-grace if God will receive <hi>Enoch</hi> at laſt; there are ſo many ſlips, ſo many failings, there are ſo many declinings, ſo many turnings aſide, there is ſo much crookedneſs in the walks of the beſt of the Saints, that if God ſhould deal with them in the rigour of his Juſtice, he might refuſe them; and therefore it's grace, it's free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that they are received, there's no other door they are to enter in at. I alſo conſidered (the laſt time) <hi>when</hi> it was that <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken, when did God take him? After he had lived three hundred ſixty and five years, which was a ſhort time, a very ſhort time in that Age, when the Patriarchs lived ſeven hundred, eight hundred, nine hundred, almoſt a thouſand years; <hi>Enoch</hi> a gracious man, one that walked with God, and yet he lived not half the years of thoſe Generations, and of his ſon that came after him: God many times ſhortens the daies of his ſervants in love. I told you what are thoſe times in which he ſhortens the daies of his ſervants in love and mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, When their lives are full of extraordinary warrings, when more than ordinary burdens are laid upon them: ſome have fiercer combatings with Satans temptations than others, and ſome have heavier bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens both of corruptions, and of afflictions than others, <hi>I am a man that have ſeen affliction,</hi> ſaies <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah;</hi> as if none beſides him had ſeen affliction;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42593:160"/> now many times God ſhortens the daies of his ſervants in love, when their combatings have been extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary with corruptions and temptations, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their affliction heavy; it's true, the Lord could deliver them ſome other way, open ſome other way beſides the door of the Grave, he could make them conquerours: but the Lord in wiſdom ſees it beſt for ſome of his ſervants, ſo long as they are in the body; in this condition it's needful for them ſo long as they are in the body to be grappling with their corruptions and temptations, fightings and buffetings; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ought not to call for death becauſe of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and becauſe of your temptations, for the Lord is pleaſed many times in wiſdom, to take this way to bring in full deliverance to his ſervants. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, When his ſervants live in a very evil time, in a corrupt Generation, then the Lord is pleaſed to ſhorten the daies of his ſervants in love: It was a corrupt time that <hi>Enoch</hi> lived in; before the Flood the earth was degenerated, and violence covered the face of the earth before the Flood came, and then it was mercy for <hi>Enoch</hi> to be taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; the Lord knows what a burden it is for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to live at ſuch a time when wickedneſs abounds, and ſo the Lord delivers many of his ſervants by ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of their courſe. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, When great Judgements are coming upon them, either upon their Families, or upon the Kingdom and place that they live in, God hath then (ſometimes) ſhortened the daies of his ſervants: as God when he intended to bring deſtruction upon <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Family, then cut ſhort the daies of one of his Children, <hi>Becauſe ſome good thing was found in him towards the Lord God of Iſrael;</hi> God cut them off every man, but he went to his grave
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42593:161"/> in peace, that he might not ſee that deſolation: and ſo good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when he was young, the Lord was pleaſed to take away him, becauſe of that Captivity which preſently came upon the Jews after his being taken away. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, Fourthly, The Lord doth ſhorten the daies of his ſervants, not becauſe the ſeed of Faith ſhould periſh, that doth abide for ever: <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not;</hi> Ay, but the actings of their Faith may decline, and Chriſtians may grow dead, and loſe their firſt love, may fall off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they may fall into Scandals, and a blurr to their Conſcience and profeſſion; now many times, the Lord to prevent this doth ſhorten the daies of ſome of his ſervants: As I gave Inſtances of King <hi>Jehoſaphat;</hi> and <hi>Aſa</hi> began to impriſon and to oppoſe, and he might have done a great deal of evil, but God ſmites him with a diſeaſe in his feet, and he died, and it was in love to his ſoul. But again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, God loves his ſervants, and therefore when they have done much in a little time, and long for his appearance, <hi>O! when ſhall I come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee?</hi> So he calls alike for them, he hath longing deſires to ſee them; when they have done the work of their Generation, he will take them to himſelf in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love and mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Is not long life a bleſſing? Hath not God promiſed to give long life to his ſervants, in <hi>Prov. 10. 27. The fear of the Lord prolongeth daies;</hi> and ſo ſee what <hi>Job</hi> ſaies, <hi>Job 5. 27. Thou ſhalt come to thy Grave in a full age, like to a Shock of Corn brought in in good ſeaſon:</hi> Now how is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made good, that God takes away ſome of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the midſt of their daies? How then do they come to the fulneſs of their daies as in age, as a Shock of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42593:161"/> Corn in its full ſeaſon? To this I may anſwer in divers things, which you may lay up for your ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, This may ſeem to be an Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Promiſe, the Promiſe of the Old Teſtament or Old Covenant; for before the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, God walked more in this way of temporal promiſes, and temporal bleſſings; and happily though there may come a time again when God ſhall walk in this way, and give out both temporal and ſpiritual, yet now Gods preſent diſpenſation ſince the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, it's more ſpiritual, he gives out more ſpirituals and leſs of temporals, he gives out more of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he hath pleaſed to reveal in and through Jeſus Chriſt, and that which he gives out now unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in ſpirituals, may abundantly recompence the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all temporal mercies whatſoever. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, That theſe Promiſes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; all outward promiſes, promiſes of riches and honour, of health and children, and promiſes of long life, theſe are all conditional, God hath not promiſed them abſolutely, but with this limitation, ſo far as he in infinite wiſdom and fatherly love and care, ſhall ſee to be good for them; ſo far the Lord will fulfill any, yea all thoſe temporal promiſes which are given out, ſo far as the Lord ſhall ſee to be good for them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Lord doth take away his ſervants, any of his ſervants betimes in the midſt of their daies, and don't give out theſe bleſſings of long life, it's becauſe the Lords ſees it's beſt for them: they are ſtrangers here, and it's not good for them that they ſhould be long from home; he ſees it in his wiſdom, I ſay, to be beſt for them, becauſe their daies are evil, it's mercy that their daies are few: God in wiſdom put both theſe together, few and evil; ſaies old <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen. 47. 9. Few and evil have the daies of the years
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42593:162"/> of my life been, and I have not attained unto the daies of the years of the life of my Fathers, in the daies of their Pilgrimage: few and evil;</hi> the Lord ſees it's good that they ſhould be few, becauſe they are evil. In <hi>Job 14. 1. Man that is born of a woman, is of few daies and full of trouble;</hi> what a mercy is it that God hath put theſe together, <hi>few daies and full of trouble!</hi> he is full of trouble, trouble from within, and trouble from without; he is troubled with corruption, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affliction, with the ſin of others, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour that is brought to God in the world: now when he is full of trouble, it's mercy that his daies are few. That's a ſecond Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But again, Thirdly, I muſt ſay to that Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the promiſe of long life to the Saints, that this promiſe is made good to a gracious man or woman; when God takes them away they are full of daies, he ſhall die in a full age, ſaies <hi>Job, Full of daies;</hi> why, a gracious man is full of daies, becauſe he is full of grace: he is full of holineſs, and goodneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath filled up his daies. A wicked man when God cuts him off, he is never full of daies, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his daies are empty, his daies are full of vanity, full of ſin, they are ſpent as a ſhadow; but a gracious man is full of goodneſs, he is fully ripe, he is ripe for heaven, he is ripe for the grave at that time when God cuts him down, for he is Gods Husbandry, God won't cut down his Corn before it be ripe, if he cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he ripens betimes, he will cauſe them to fulfill their daies, God will fill their daies full of grace and holineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, Fourthly, We may ſee that this promiſe is made good, for a gracious man hath enough of life, when God calls him to die he hath enough of life; ſo that he is not taken away before his time, why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42593:162"/> he hath enough of life: <hi>It is enough,</hi> ſaies the Prophet, <hi>Lord it is enough, therefore take me away; I am no better than my Fathers;</hi> even ſo God cauſeth his people to ſay, though he takes them away betimes, yet they ſhall ſay, <hi>Lord it is enough,</hi> I have enough of life, I have enough of the world, I ſee nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable here, nothing that may provoke me to live longer here, and therefore if the Lord ſay, <hi>It is enough,</hi> he'll ſay it's enough too. But this won't the wicked man, he will never ſay he hath enough: let him live an hundred years, twice, thrice told, yet he'll never have enough: the righteous come to the Grave, but the wicked is dragg'd and haled to his Grave, he is not a Volunteer to his Grave. And therefore here is the promiſe made good, if God ſatisfie the hearts of his people, and enable them to ſay, Lord I have enough, enough of the world here, and if thou pleaſeſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire my daies, I can ſay, I have enough, I have enough.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Again, The time of the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this promiſe of long life to be given out is not yet come; there's a day when it ſhall be given out, when it ſhall be mercy to live long, when God ſhall give out long life: there ſeems to be ſuch a thing ſpoken of; it is Propheſied by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 65. 22. this Prophecie relates to the end of the world, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies when there ſhall be a great reſtauration of the world, and of all things, they ſhall not be cut off in the midſt of their daies as formerly; ſaies God, <hi>They ſhall not build, and another inhabit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhall not build houſes, and be cut off before they can build; they ſhall not plant, and another eat, for as the daies of a tree, are the daies of my people, and mine elect ſhall long enjoy the works of their hands:</hi> they ſhall be as the long-liv'd Oaks; this promiſe God will fulfil before
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42593:163"/> the end, and it ſhall be a mercy then to live long; when the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall come down from heaven, and when the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſhall be the light of the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when Satan ſhall be bound, and ſhall not ſeduce the Nations, and tempt them, and when all enemies ſhall be put under the ſoals of their feet, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be a peaceable habitation, and a quiet reſting place, when there ſhall be peace upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then long life ſhall be a bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly and laſtly, When God will fulfil this, it ſhall be a time of the accompliſhment of the promiſes, in that God gives life and length of daies, <hi>even for ever and ever;</hi> there is the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore God is not behind-hand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this promiſe, if he promiſe long life on earth, and give an eternity of life in heaven, the creature is no loſer; if a man ſhall promiſe you a ſhilling, and when he comes to pay, he ſhall give you a thouſand pounds, will not you ſay this man is as good as his word? The Lord hath promiſed a long time on earth, and an eternity in heaven, you may well ſay it of him who is truth it ſelf, that he will fulfil and make good his word: and therefore notwithſtanding what may be objected, yet ſtill it's true, it's not againſt the promiſe; but God may in love and mercy ſhorten the daies of his people.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we learn from this, God ſhortens the daies of his ſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts in love? It will be uſeful to us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers waies. Why,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt of all, It lets us ſee that life and death is in the hand of God; God ſhortens, <hi>God took him,</hi> I ſay, life and death is in the hand of God, it's not in the hand of any creature whatſoever, <hi>My times are in thy hand,</hi> ſaies <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>He that is our God is the God of Salvation, and to him belong the iſſues of Death:</hi> Enemies think that it is in their power to harm
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42593:163"/> or to cut off; <hi>Laban</hi> thought it in his power to cut off <hi>Jacob;</hi> but he was deceived, it's in the hand of no creature to cut off the time of Gods ſervants, but at the appointment of the Lord; and God doth it in love, when he cuts ſhort the time of his ſervants, it's in love; if any wicked man ſhall attempt any thing againſt the lives of his ſervants, that's from the malice of Hell, which God will avenge; and if any man ſhall attempt againſt his own life, that is not without horrible ſin, for though God can cut ſhort in love, yet if thou doſt cut ſhort thine own life, it's not without horrible ſin; though indeed when God ſhortens, it's alwaies in love: for what's the creature? Ah poor creature, a worm, that he ſhould ſtep up in the ſeat of God, and ſhould pluck the iſſues of life and death out of the hand of God, which God doth challenge in a peculiar manner as his right. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, It may teach us, that though God cut ſhort the time of his ſervants in love, yet he may cut ſhort the time of many in wrath, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wrath: when his own people are ripe for heaven, he reaps them; and when wicked men are ripe for deſtruction, the Lord alſo cuts them down. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 23. it's ſaid there of wicked men, <hi>That blood-thirſty and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their daies;</hi> God will cut them off in wrath: they ſhall live out thoſe daies that God hath determined, yet they ſhall not live out half their daies in the courſe of nature that they might have done: and therefore ſee what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies in <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 17. Be not thou over-much wicked, neither be thou fooliſh, why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time:</hi> wickedneſs brings men to end their time before the courſe of nature be extinct; Oh, that wicked men would think of this; it would be very ſad if their own hands ſhould be upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42593:164"/> to bring them down: though it is mercy to the Saints at ſome times to be taken away early, yet when wicked men are cut off in the midſt of their daies, it is not without a great deal of diſpleaſure and wrath of God. That's a ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Thirdly, This may teach us this Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, If God deal thus with his own people, what ſhall be the portion of the wicked? If this be done to the green tree, what ſhall become of the dry? If God cut off young Saints, what ſhall become of old ſinners? Oh! that the hear-ſay of this diſpenſation might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſome, and move them to awake, and ſay, <hi>Come let us eat and drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and more abundant:</hi> Why do you put off the thoughts of God and Eternity to old age, and ſpeak of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God another time? when thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth, thou knoweſt not what may lie in the womb of to morrow; God cuts off ſometimes ſome of his people in the midſt of their daies, and what ſhall become of you? I ſhall ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you in the words of the Apoſtle <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 4. 13. and the Lord ſet them home to your hearts, <hi>Go to now, ye that ſay To day or to morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy and ſell and get gain: whereas you know not what ſhall be on the morrow: for what is your life?</hi> He ſhews the vanity of the cares of this life, and of wicked worldly men; they dream of a long time, of a continuance, and we will ſtay there a year; <hi>A year,</hi> ſaies he? thou knoweſt not what to morrow may bring forth; thou ſaieſt, <hi>Stay, we will heap goods up,</hi> and <hi>what knoweſt thou, O fool, but this night thy ſoul may be taken away?</hi> Oh! that men, wicked men, and worldly men would look to themſelves, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to themſelves time for hereafter; and if this be
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42593:164"/> done to the green tree, what will be done to the dry? But again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Fourthly, This may be a ground of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the ſervants of God in the midſt of all their affliction; in the midſt of all temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever; poſſeſs your ſouls in patience; Why? becauſe the time is ſhort, and if it be good for you, the Lord will make your daies few, becauſe they are evil; therefore poſſeſs your ſouls in patience: you complain of your afflictions; Why? they are not for an Eternity, a few daies, thoſe daies are ſhortened, if you ſhould live as long as they did before the Flood, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, eight or nine hundred years, and all the time be tempted and afflicted; but now for the Elects ſake, thoſe daies are ſhortened: your burden is but for a little time, your reſt is long, therefore poſſeſs your ſouls with patience; O the wiſdom and goodneſs of God in walking in this way, to and with his people! if your afflictions had been heavy and long too, that had been ſad. It is the miſery of Hell, heavy burdens to Eternity is the miſery of Hell; Ay, but Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to you is quite contrary, and otherwiſe; when your daies are evil they ſhall be few, and but for a little while, but when joy comes, that ſhall be for Eternity; O the goodneſs of Gods diſpenſation! few daies when they are evil, and an Eternity of daies when entering into the poſſeſſion of Joy: poſſeſs your ſouls with patience.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, Again, Will God cut off the times of his beſt ſervants? See and take that Counſel in <hi>Iſa. 2. 22. Ceaſe ye from man whoſe breath is in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Ceaſe ye from man, from the beſt of men, for their breath is in their noſtrils: Ceaſe from affecting them over much, do not let the ſtream of your affections be
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42593:165"/> any way inordinate, for wherein are they to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted? Remember what the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>The time is ſhort, the faſhion of this world paſſeth away:</hi> when he goes about to other things concerning this world, <hi>The time is ſhort,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ceaſe ye from man,</hi> and ceaſe from truſting in him, <hi>his breath is in his noſtrils;</hi> don't lay too much weight upon any man, the Lord cuts ſhort the daies of the beſt of his ſervants; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſt not in, don't lay too much weight upon them, don't ſay the comfort of your lives is bound up in them, and you can't live comfortably without them: oh, ceaſe ye from truſting in man, it's much better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in man: by laying weight upon the creature you may break the creature; therefore take heed, though God may take away them that you truſt in, in love and mercy, he may ſhorten their daies in love, yet ceaſe ye from truſting in man. That's a fifth. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 6. Sixthly, This may teach you to take heed of murmuring and repining when God takes away any of your relations in the midſt of their years and daies; Oh, how full of carnal reaſonings are they? Oh, you conceive it much better if they had lived longer, if they had lived to mans age; what an honour might they have been to God, and a comfort to you if they had lived longer? Theſe are carnal reaſonings that ariſe from the fleſh; know aſſuredly that if God ſhortened their daies it was in love, it was beſt for them that they were ſo taken away, taken away at that time: why will you teach God? Will you teach God to gather in his Corn, in what ſeaſon he ſhall do it? Know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly he will take them at the beſt, he will crop them at the beſt ſeaſon, he loves his ſervants well, and he will put them off at the beſt advantage, both in life and death: and therefore know aſſuredly that whatſoever
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42593:165"/> carnal reaſon may ſay on the contrary, it was according to the diſpenſation of Gods love, though he takes them away in the midſt of their daies. That's a ſixth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 7. Seventhly, It may be a word of conviction to ſuch as have lived long, and have loſt of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer forwardneſs and zeal for God, ſuch as have lived to grow worſe; lived to be ſcandalous to the name of God, and to a holy profeſſion; Oh, my friends, what ſhall we ſay? But that God orders things in infinite wiſdom, you might ſay, poor creature, how much better had it been if God had taken you away before! Oh! to live to be a diſhonour to God, to live to loſe thy firſt love, and thy firſt zeal and forwardneſs for God, to be a ſcandal to profeſſion, oh better that you had been taken away at the firſt, better that you had been hid in the Grave many years ago, that now your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſhould be diſcovered to the diſhonour of your profeſſion! and yet don't you ſay, there is no hope, and therefore we will wait no longer; the Lord invites you to return; return; oh that you would ſeek after your firſt love, and firſt zeal: ſtrengthen the feeble hands and knees; if the Lord ſhould come and take you away whilſt you are in this condition, oh how uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable will it be unto you, very uncomfortable! you loſe your Crown; though I know (if you have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt) the Crown of glory is ſafe, yet there is a Crown which you will loſe, if you return not ſpeedily to the Lord; the Crown of a Chriſtian is to flouriſh green, and be fruitful in old age, fat and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Courts of the Lord; to be freſh and ſweet, and to ſend forth an excellent ſavour, this is the Crown of a Chriſtian, and this Crown you may loſe, if death comes upon you whilſt you are in that declining condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Oh, therefore make haſt to the Lord, pour out your cry continually that the Lord would be pleaſed to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42593:166"/> reſtore you again, and to eſtabliſh you with his free ſpirit, that you may be freſh, fruitful and ſweet, and may not be withered in time of gathering, when God ſhall come to pull and gather you; if you be dead and withered, you loſe all your ſweet ſcent. Oh, beg of the Lord that you may not be in that condition at that time when he ſhall come to gather you into his Barn. That's a ſeventh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 8. Eightly, Let us pray and wait for that time which before was ſpoken of, when there ſhall be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in long life, when long life ſhall be a mercy unto all the Saints, when the daies of the Lords people ſhall be as the daies of a tree, and the Elect ſhall long enjoy the works of their hands; Oh, pray for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that promiſe, it will be very ſweet: how much ſhall the Saints gain at that time, how much knowledge? yea, how much ſhall they do for God? Alas! we are of yeſterday, and know nothing; oh get large experience, renewed experience: they ſhall grow in that day like an Oak tree, or a Cedar; there ſhall be no hindrances of growth; pray and wait for the accompliſhment of that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 9. Ninthly, This may ſupport againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of a ſhort life, and a long uncomfortable; Oh, ſaies the ſoul, I am preſſing after the Lord, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him, and this is my fear, I ſhall be cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his work be done in me.</p>
            <p>Fear it not, the Lord will not cut off the daies of his ſervants but in love; if it be not for thy good, it ſhall not come unto thee: Old <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for the conſolations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he might have many diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what hopes had he to ſee Chriſt when he had one foot in the Grave? And yet at laſt he ſaw Chriſt the hope of his Salvation. But they may think if they ſhould live, they ſhould live to decay in profeſſion,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42593:166"/> and to go backward; Oh fear not, <hi>I am perſwaded, neither things preſent, nor things to come,</hi> even old age, <hi>ſhall ſeparate you from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Though God do ſend for ſome of his ſervants, it's no argument that he don't love you though you live long; <hi>Mathuſalem</hi> lived nine hundred years, the reſt of the Patriarchs were holy men as well as others. That's a Ninth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 10. Tenthly, This may teach to covet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live much, rather than to live long: Oh, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to do much for God while ye live, to do much for God in the ſervice of your Generation; <hi>What ever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might;</hi> labour to redeem time, and take all ſeaſons, and all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of getting nigher God; Oh, loſe no opportunity, loſe no part of precious time: A Heathen could ſay, <hi>There's no time paſt, but there's ſomething is worth the writing;</hi> let no part of your precious time be waſte and nothing done; time is ſhort, and therefore you had need live every part of time, live every hour, and live every moment; rather covet to live much than long: Oh, labour for an eternal life, this life is ſhort, in a moment God ſhortens the time of the beſt of his ſervants; and therefore if this time be ſhort, oh labour for an eternal life; and do what you do for God, with all your might, and with all your ſtrength. He is an unwiſe man that will protract time, that will do that in a year which he might do in a day; Oh, covet much, you have a pattern of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he lived not long on earth, but he did much in a little time, he wrought whilſt it was day, he knew the night was coming; Chriſt did ſo, and Satan doth ſo, he knows his time is ſhort, and he beſtirs himſelf, he knows it muſt be now or never: if Satan be thus wiſe for his Kingdom, ſhall not we that profeſs our ſelves to be
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42593:167"/> Chriſts, be thus wiſe in the matters of his Kingdom? Here is all the time you have to work in, oh you have no more working daies, work apace for God, for in the end of the ſix daies of this life there's a reſt a coming; there's no work beyond the Grave, either in heaven or in hell; you that are Chriſts, you ſhall not work after this life is at an end, your reſt comes then; yea, that's the time of your ſitting down, this is the time of your walking, not the time of your reſt; and ſeeing you have no more time to eternity to work in, there's no more working daies, be content to work now, be earneſtly deſirous to do all you can to lift up God and Chriſt, and his Kingdom, whilſt you are on earth; for what know you, your time is ſhort, and what know you, but that you may live even as <hi>Enoch,</hi> whoſe life was but half the daies of the reſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs? Thus I have ſhewn you at what time <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken, at three hundred ſixty and five years: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains further to enquire, Wherefore did God take <hi>Enoch</hi> away, and why he did take him away at that time? and wherefore <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken in that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, both ſoul and body to Heaven?</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42593:168"/> muſt be taken with this limitation; ſo far as God in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom ſhall ſee to be beſt for them, ſo far ſhall he give out to them; and therefore if God do take away any of his people at any time, it is becauſe God ſees it beſt for them to be taken home to himſelf, it is beſt for them to have a ſhort time, becauſe that their daies are evil, <hi>Man that is born of a woman,</hi> ſaies <hi>Job, is one of few daies, and full of trouble;</hi> and there is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that both theſe go together, <hi>few of daies and full of trouble.</hi> Beſides I anſwered, That the promiſe is made good, though God do take away ſome of his people whilſt young, yet the promiſe is made good; they come to the Grave in full age, becauſe they come to the Grave full of grace, he is not cut down before he is ripe, they are not like the Corn on the houſe top that is burnt up before it is ripe, but God can make them full of grace, which is a full age; and herein his promiſe is made good. Beſides, his promiſe is made good, becauſe God makes them willing to leave the world when he calls for them: the righteous man when God calls for him, he ſaies as <hi>Elias</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord it is enough,</hi> if thou ſaieſt it is enough that I have lived ſo long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, I will ſay ſo too, Lord I have enough of living here, I have enough of this world, here's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is deſirable, or that may draw forth my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to live longer, if this be the determined time of God. A wicked man hath never life enough, though he liveth a hundred years, twice told, yet he is as gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to live longer, as at firſt; but God ſatisfies the hearts of his ſervants, in that they have lived long enough, and their time is come, and that ſatisfies them; and thus they have length of daies continued. And beſides, God doth promiſe to his people a great reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is to be before the end of the world: as the daies of a tree, ſo ſhall the daies of my ſervants be,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:42593:168"/> and mine Elect they ſhall long enjoy the work of their hands; it ſhall then be a mercy to live long, when the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall come down from heaven, and when the Lamb ſhall be the light of it, when Satan ſhall be bound, and the Accuſer of the Brethren caſt out, and wicked men put under, when corruption ſhall be ſubdued, then long life ſhall be a mercy. But however I anſwer, That if God do ſhorten our daies here and give us an Eternity in heaven, we are no loſers, but God is as good as his word. If a man promiſe you a Shilling, and ſhall at that day give you a hundred or a thouſand pounds, he is not unfaithful, but he is as good as his word; and thus the Lord promiſed long life, which is an eternity, better than life here, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he fulfils his word. It ſhould and ought to be the deſire of all to live much, rather than to live long, to live much in a little time; thus did Chriſt, he lived much, he glorified the name of his Father in the time he lived, he did much in a little time; and thus it ſhould be our care, to do much for God in a little time, and to lay hold of eternal life betimes; becauſe this life is momentany and vaniſhing; the Devil takes his opportunity, he works much, knowing he hath but a little time, becauſe he knows his time is ſhort, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he works with all his might, and plyes his work to deceive the Nations.</p>
            <p>If he be ſo ſubtile for his Kingdom, how wiſe ought we to be to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt? Oh! whatſoever we find to do for God, let us do it with all our might, and with all our ſtrength; for thus hath Chriſt given us his Example. I ſhall proceed to that which remains, <hi>God took him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhewed you before, Whither <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken: He was taken up into Heaven, he was not diſſolved, he died not as other men; I proved it from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42593:169"/> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that he was <hi>tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Wherefore was <hi>Enoch</hi> thus <hi>tranſlated?</hi> Why was he not diſſolved? Why died he not as others? Why tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, Becauſe he was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Type of Jeſus Chriſt; I ſay, he was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Type of Chriſt. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, He was matchleſs in his Generation, <hi>There was none like him,</hi> above all the men in the world <hi>Enoch</hi> walk'd moſt cloſe with God in his time, he was match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and none like him, and herein he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, who was matchleſs in the world; whilſt he was in the world, he was as the <hi>Apple-tree in the midſt of the Trees in the Foreſt, there was no guile found in his mouth;</hi> he walked exactly with God when he was here upon earth, there was no ſtumbling blocks, no ſlips in the whole courſe of Jeſus Chriſt. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, in that God was ſo exceedingly <hi>well pleaſed</hi> with him; <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Teſtimony,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. that <hi>he pleaſed God;</hi> God was pleaſed with him, and herein he was a notable Type of Chriſt: the Father is pleaſed only in him, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold,</hi> ſaies he in <hi>Iſa. 42. 1. mine Elect in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth:</hi> he was infinitely well pleaſed with Chriſt; the good pleaſure of God towards <hi>Enoch,</hi> it was but a drop of that love, and that good pleaſure which was poured out upon the head of Jeſus Chriſt; the Father was pleaſed with his Perſon, infinitely pleaſed in his righteouſneſs, pleaſed in all that he did, and pleaſed in his ſufferings, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. It pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him;</hi> he was pleaſed with all thoſe that Chriſt repreſented, he is pleaſed with the whole Family of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42593:169"/> Chriſt, even with all that belong unto him in Heaven and Earth, and that only for his ſake; it is ſaid of him in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. the latter end, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> So then my Brethren, is there ever a ſoul that is ſeeking after the good pleaſure of God? the manifeſtation of the love of God unto it? that is looking and waiting for ſome token of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance from heaven? Would you be in the ready way unto it? Then look unto the Lord, even Jeſus Chriſt, of whom <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Type, look unto him in his love, all the love and all the good pleaſure that is in the heart of God, runs down through Jeſus Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poor creatures: Oh, run to Chriſt, make haſt to Chriſt, throw down your ſelves at the Foot-ſtool of Chriſt, and claſp about him by Faith, and know that there is a plentiful Box of good pleaſure and love broken upon the head of Chriſt by the Father, that will run down unto every ſoul that ſits under the skirt and ſhadow of Chriſt. That's a Second thing, wherein <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Type of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, as Chriſt was a Conqueror over <hi>Death;</hi> and this was held forth in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s tranſlation, <hi>He did not ſee Death; Enoch</hi> did not ſee corruption as the bodies of others do, and he was in this a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, that was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of God, that he ſhould not ſee corruption; he did not ſee corruption; <hi>Enoch</hi>'s conqueſt was but a Type of this conqueſt and victory of Jeſus Chriſt, that he got for his people over Death and the Grave: and therefore you that deſire not to be diſmayed when Death comes, when this enemy ſhall ſet upon you; Oh, that you would before-hand look unto the conqueſt and victory of Chriſt. There is a time when this your enemy will meet you all in the Field: Would you not be diſmayed? Would you be able to look Death in the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42593:170"/> face? Then I beſeech you, before-hand, live upon Faith in Chriſt, upon the conqueſt of Chriſt, upon the victory of Chriſt, he hath broken the force of death, taken away the ſting of it, he hath diſmayed it. Oh, live upon the conqueſt that Chriſt hath made over death, that ſo your hearts may not fail when you come to grapple with this laſt enemy, which is Death, Chriſt hath overcome Death gloriouſly; and <hi>Enoch</hi> was but a Type of Chriſt, and a ſhadow of it in his tranſlation. That's the firſt, wherefore <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated in an extraordinary way, becauſe he was an extraordinary Type of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. But Secondly, <hi>Enoch</hi> was thus tranſlated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Enoch</hi> whilſt he lived, exerciſed a ſpecial faith; I ſay, <hi>Enoch</hi> had a ſpecial Faith, a moſt remarkable faith, in ſome good and great deliverance that God would work for him either in Death or from Death: He truſted God whilſt he lived in victory over Death, that Death ſhould be conquered for him, and Death if it came ſhould do him no harm; I ſay, he had a ſpecial faith in this reſpect; It appears by two Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, In reſpect of that bold, that holy bold profeſſion that <hi>Enoch</hi> makes of God in his Generation, which was a moſt corrupt time, and dangerous to make any profeſſion of God in: righteous <hi>Abel</hi> was killed for his profeſſion, for his walking with God, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aroſe up and ſlew him, and yet <hi>Enoch</hi> is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, he will not turn aſide from God, he will not balk his profeſſion for fear of death, for fear of the ſons of violence; the poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> was multiplied, and the earth was filled with violence at that time, and there was enmity in that ſeed of <hi>Cain,</hi> againſt the ſeed of <hi>Seth,</hi> which God raiſed up inſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> ſo that it was dangerous for <hi>Enoch</hi> to make any profeſſion of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42593:170"/> God in his Generation; and yet <hi>Enoch</hi> was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, he feared not the hand of violence what it could do to him, but he truſted that God would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him either from Death or in Death. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It appears that <hi>Enoch</hi> had ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable faith, if we conſider what was the name that he gave unto his Son, as in this Chapter, <hi>He begat a Son, and called his name Methuſelah,</hi> that is, <hi>Mortis gladium,</hi> the ſword of Death, or the dart of Death, he believed there was one a coming that ſhould be the death of Death; one that ſhould overcome death for him, and for all the people of God, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſon after that name, <hi>The Sword of Death:</hi> He knew there was a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> a coming that ſhould ſend a challenge to death, as in <hi>Hoſ. 13. 14. O death, I will be thy Plague; O Grave, I will be thy deſtruction;</hi> Chriſt ſent a challenge and perform'd this; <hi>Enoch</hi> ſaw this by faith, and all his daies he lived in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of it, and ſucked ſweetneſs in the thoughts of it, and when e're death came, he believed it ſhould do him no harm. This will teach us three or four Leſſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is nothing loſt by making a bold profeſſion of Chriſt in evil times, in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlain becauſe he walked with God, and yet <hi>Enoch</hi> will not go back, and <hi>Enoch</hi> loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in concluſion; Oh, how often doth our Saviour call upon Chriſtians, his Diſciples and others, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body,</hi> and can do no more; <hi>the fear of man brings a ſnare;</hi> how many poor creatures are inſnared through this fear, the fear of man? That when God convinces of the truth, and of the way of God, the ſoul ſubmits unto it, and yet dares not hold it forth, becauſe of the fear of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's a way that may be perſecuted, that the Powers
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42593:171"/> of the world will perſecute it, and oppoſe it; O this fear of man brings a ſnare; what ſaies our Saviour in <hi>Matth. 10. 39. He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, but he that will loſe his life, ſhall find it;</hi> it is made good many times in this world: <hi>He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it;</hi> when a man will turn aſide from God, when he will balk any way of God to ſave his life, or to ſave ſome comforts of his life, Oh, it will befall that poor creature as with the Prophet, <hi>Some Lion comes in the way, he meets him and ſlays him:</hi> But <hi>he that will loſe his life ſhall ſave it;</hi> he remembers the <hi>three Children</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel,</hi> they loſt nothing by their bold profeſſion, they were willing to loſe their lives, and ſo they ſaved their lives: and thus did they, and ſo did <hi>Enoch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It doth teach us how much God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the faith of his people: <hi>Enoch</hi> lived by <hi>Faith</hi> in a ſpecial manner, and how was the heart of God taken with <hi>Enoch?</hi> He was well pleaſing unto God, ſo well pleaſing that God could not long be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; puts forth his hand and takes him up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Oh, how greatly is the heart of God and Chriſt taken with Faith! We never read that Jeſus Chriſt wondred at any thing but at <hi>Faith:</hi> twice he wondred at the Faith that was given out to ſome of his ſervants; as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. Chriſt wondred at it, <hi>O,</hi> ſaies he, at the 10 Verſe, <hi>when Jeſus Chriſt heard it, he marvelled and ſaid to them that followed him, Verily I ſay unto you, I have not found ſo great a Faith, no, not in Iſrael; When Jeſus Chriſt heard it, he marvelled;</hi> and ſo the heart of Chriſt was taken with the Faith that was given out to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in <hi>Matth. 15. O woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt:</hi> Faith gains the will of Chriſt; what a great deal hath God done to encourage his people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42593:171"/> Faith finds not what it expecteth, but it finds more than ever it expected; certainly <hi>Methuſelah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved death ſhould do him no harm, and therefore he feared not death, and thought not of ſuch a way as this is, but God was better to him than his Faith. You have a ſtrong God, what encouragement is here? You have a ſtrong Saviour; O let not your faith be weak, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing the Lord is ſo delighted with it; he gives faith whatſoever it expects; nay, even beyond it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, This teaches us, That to live much by faith is the way to make our tranſlation eaſie; thus it was with <hi>Enoch,</hi> he lived all his daies by faith, and ſee how eaſie his tranſlation was to him: there's nothing honours God in the world ſo much as faith doth; now therefore God delights to honour Faith, becauſe it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him, it hath the promiſe, <hi>They that honour me, I will honour;</hi> I beſeech you then, you that would have an eaſie change (and who would not have an eaſie change, an eaſie tranſlation? when death comes who would not have a large door ſet open to them, and go with full ſails for heaven?) If this be the deſire of your hearts, then labour to live much by faith; it is faith that will ſet the door wide open, it will miniſter abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of entrance into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord; the ſpirit of faith will fill the ſoul with full ſails, it ſhall go to Heaven with full ſails; thus it was with <hi>Enoch,</hi> who lived by faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But again, Fourthly, A fourth thing that we may learn is this, that when God doth give out a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial faith, he doth give out ſome ſpecial mercy; when God gives out a ſpecial faith, a particular faith, he that perſwades the heart to believe it, it ſhall be eaſie to him. <hi>Enoch</hi> was perſwaded in a ſpecial faith to believe ſomething concerning death that God would do for
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42593:172"/> 
               <hi>Enoch,</hi> and he did believe; it is rare and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this ſpecial faith that doth concern ſuch and ſuch as a ſpecial mercy that God doth put the ſoul to ſeek after it, if the heart be perſwaded by God to believe ſuch a particular mercy to be given out, certainly if God do perſwade the heart to wait for that mercy, that mercy ſhall be given out: ſee <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 27. 4. One thing have I deſired of the Lord: that will I ſeek after; that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> There he had a deſire to come back again to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſee the Lord in his Temple, and his heart was carried out ſtrongly to believe it; he was baniſhed by <hi>Saul</hi> a mighty King, and he durſt not come into the Land, and how then could he come to the Temple? yet he would not fear, for that one thing that God had put in his heart to ſeek after, for that his heart was upheld in it. And thus God may deal with ſome of his ſervants, when he doth raiſe up his peoples hearts to believe ſome ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that mercy ſhall be given out according to their faith. That's a ſecond mercy why <hi>Enoch</hi> was thus tranſlated, he was one that had a ſpecial remarkable ſaith, that ſomething God ſhould do for him in or about Death.</p>
            <p>There's a third Queſtion follows, Wherefore <hi>Enoch</hi> was thus tranſlated?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, That ſo his tranſlation might preach unto the men of that Generation, yea, to all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations, that there ſhall be a <hi>Reſurrection of the Body:</hi> I ſay, therefore did God thus tranſlate <hi>Enoch,</hi> that his tranſlation in body to heaven might wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, and ſo to all other Generations, that there is a time when that the bodies of the Saints ſhall be co-partners with their ſouls in Glory: Here God
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42593:172"/> Preached the Doctrin of the Reſurrection of the Body, by <hi>Enoch</hi>'s tranſlation; in all Ages God hath not left himſelf without witneſs, concerning this great truth, the Reſurrection of the Body; and certainly the Lord ſaw that there was need that he ſhould bear witneſs of this truth: there was need then, and there is need now, even in this Generation, that we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, perſwaded, and rooted in this Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body;</hi> there's great need that Chriſtians ſhould be confirmed in it, in the knowledge and in the full perſwaſion of it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, It is the Doctrine that the Devil hath alwaies ſought to over-throw, the powers of Hell have bandyed againſt it, and how hath the Devil by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, by Atheiſtical men oppoſed this Doctrin in every Age? It hath been oppoſed, and it is ſtill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. I ſhall ſhew you what oppoſition is made againſt it, that ſo you may be confirmed in it. It's ſad to think that ſome that have formerly made a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould fall ſo far as to deny a Reſurrection; and yet ſuch a ſeducing ſpirit is gone forth in the world: I ſhall ſhew you what the Atheiſt hath againſt it, that your hearts may be confirmed in this Doctrin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why, Firſt, Say they, it's againſt reaſon: How is it poſſible that the bodies of men ſhould be raiſed up again, whenas their bodies are devoured &amp; conſumed in the heart of the earth, they are turned into the very elements again, into their firſt principles, and how is it poſſible that the ſame bodies ſhould be raiſed up again?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this, I'le anſwer in the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, <hi>O,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>you erre, not knowing the Scripture, nor the power of God;</hi> for that was the anſwer that Chriſt gave unto the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Reſurrection, in <hi>Matth. 22. 29. Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> he tells them, they were not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42593:173"/> acquainted with that which God had ſpoken in his Word, he brings one Scripture that they did not know, and therefore they erred becauſe they did not know it: <hi>Have not you read,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> they ſaid there was no Reſurrection; ſaies Chriſt, Poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you ſay ſo, becauſe you don't know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ye err therefore becauſe you know not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: God ſaies, <hi>I am the God of Abraham;</hi> God ſaies this after <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are dead and gone, that he is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore there is ſomething of <hi>Abraham</hi> yet remains, and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall live again, for God ſaies he owns them, and ſaies, ye know not the power of God, <hi>Ye err not knowing the Scriptures, and the power of God:</hi> you meaſure God by the arm of fleſh, becauſe it's impoſſible to you, you think it's impoſſible to God, whenas God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and can do whatſoever he pleaſe; if you did but conſider the power of God, ſaies he, you would not err on this manner, even to deny the Reſurrection as a thing impoſſible: Why, who made the world? Who made all things out of nothing? Who brought light out of darkneſs? Certainly to raiſe up the dead is not a greater matter than to make the World of nothing; certainly if you had known the Scriptures, you would not have denied the power of God in raiſing from the dead. But the Devil is ſubtil, and therefore when reaſon won't do, he flees to Scripture, he'll bring you Scripture to deny the Reſurrection; that Scripture is urged by ſome Atheiſtical ſpirits, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 50. Now this I ſay Brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> therefore, ſay they, the Scripture is againſt the Reſurrection, there ſhall be no reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="361" facs="tcp:42593:173"/>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That ſinful fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, corrupt man cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; but the bodies of the Saints ſhall be raiſed without ſin, there ſhall be no defilement when they come out of the Grave, they ſhall be purified ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently; and therefore then they may inherit the Kingdom of God. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It's true, that weak, frail, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, but when the bodies of the Saints be raiſed up, they ſhall not be weak, frail and corruptible as their bodies are now; no, they ſhall leave all their weakneſſes, all their frailties ſhall be left behind them, all theſe ſhall be left in the Grave; therefore the Apoſtle anſwers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in the 53 verſe of that Chapter, <hi>For this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on Immortality;</hi> frail corruptible fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God: but it ſhall not be ſo at the Reſurrection, but <hi>this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this poor mortal body ſhall put on Immortality,</hi> it ſhall no more be cloathed with frail fleſh and blood, but it ſhall put on new robes, new robes that ſhall not be changed, and that are not ſubject to change, that ſhall not wear away, but ſhall abide for ever in the Heavens, and therefore there is nothing in this againſt the Reſurrection of the body, but it ſhall be partner with the ſoul in the bleſſedneſs of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But there's another place that the Atheiſt doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from Scripture, and that is from <hi>Solomon,</hi> what he ſaies in <hi>Eccleſ. 3. 19. For that which befalleth the ſons of men, befalleth Beaſts, even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, ſo dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath, ſo that a man hath no prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above a beaſt: for all is vanity.</hi> Hence the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42593:174"/> Atheiſt concludes that there's no Reſurrection, for when death comes, it's with man as a beaſt; who knoweth the ſpirit of man that goeth upward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt that goeth downward?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not ſpeak in his own perſon, he ſpeaks in the perſon of the Atheiſt, he tells you what is the Atheiſts concluſion, what he ſaies in his heart becauſe of thoſe oppreſſions that he ſaw under the Sun, <hi>I ſaid in my heart concerning the eſtate of the ſons of men, that God might manifeſt them, and that they might ſee that they themſelves are beaſts.</hi> There you have the thoughts of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there he ſpeaks his own, it was a concluſion of his from the obſervation that he ſaw under the Sun, to ſee how one man oppreſſed another, even like beaſts; and there he brings in the concluſion of the fleſh, and the concluſion of the ſpirit: the concluſion of the ſpirit is, <hi>God ſhall judge betwixt the righteous and the wicked,</hi> and ſo he brings them in ſcoffingly, Who knows the ſpirit of a man that goeth upward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſee it was not <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, it was far from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s thoughts that there ſhould be no Reſurrection, in <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9. Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the daies of thy youth, and walk in the light of thine eyes: But know thou, for all theſe things God will bring thee into Judgement. Solomon</hi> concludes with the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it was the concluſion of his Book, in his laſt Chapter, 13, 14 verſes, <hi>Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God ſhall bring every work into Judgement, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> You ſee how the Devil by his Agents doth ſtrike at this Doctrin of the Reſurrection, he deſtroies all
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42593:174"/> Godlineſs, all the power of Godlineſs, he deſtroies the Kingdom of God at once, and he builds up his own Kingdom for ever; If there be no Reſurrection, then ſaies the Atheiſt, <hi>Let us eat and drink, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhall be as this day, and more abundant: If our hopes were only in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> it deſtroies the whole myſterie of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then all ſhould be in vain, Preaching and Hearing in vain, and your faith in vain, if there be no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Now therefore, I beſeech you, get your hearts eſtabliſhed in this Reſurrection. The Devil plaies not at ſmall game, but he ſtrikes at the fulneſs of the root, at the Scriptures, he ſtrikes at the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. O get your hearts eſtabliſhed. Some that have been as ſtars in the Firmament, have been ſwept down ſo low as to deny the Reſurrection of the body: know therefore that it is the Will of the Father, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould raiſe up; all his people at the laſt day; ſo he tells them, and ſo he would have all his people believe it, it is the Will of the Father, that <hi>of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none, but he will raiſe them up at the laſt day:</hi> and know that your bodies ſhall as certainly be raiſed up again, as the body of Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed up, there was a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertue in Chriſt, but it was not ſo in others, they did riſe, but Chriſt aroſe as a common perſon, and his Reſurrection is as the ſeed of the Reſurrection of their bodies in the concluſion; even as certainly as Chriſts body was raiſed from the Grave, ſo ſhall thine; and know if it were not ſo, Chriſt ſhould not be compleat, the body of Chriſt ſhould not be compleat; for all his people are a part of his body, if the head be riſen, the members alſo ſhall riſe, for Chriſt without them is not compleat: and the body ſhall ariſe, becauſe without the body the man is not compleat; I ſay, man is not
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42593:175"/> compleat without the body; the ſoul waits for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, it is not compleat, it hath not its fulneſs of joy untill the Reſurrection: and therefore it's ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. the ſouls under the Altar cry out, <hi>How long Lord holy and true, doſt not thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> The ſoul thinks long when it ſhall meet with its old friend again, the body: Oh Lord how long, ſay they, ſhall we be in this condition? Now ſeeing it is ſo, there ſhall certainly be a Reſurrection of the body at laſt: and if there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the body, then I beſeech you, conſider <hi>what manner of perſons we ought to be,</hi> how ſhould you endeavour after holineſs in the body, ſeeing there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the body; whilſt you are in the body, how ſhould you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean your ſelves in all holineſs? O what need is there that you ſhould get faith in Chriſt, to cover, and to waſh away all thoſe ſins and defilements of the body? And how careful ſhould you be to keep your bodies ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Temples of the holy Ghoſt? That ſo when your ſouls and bodies are parted, there may be a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Reſurrection, that your ſoul may ſay, Lord how long, how long, when ſhall that poor body that ſleeps in the duſt be raiſed up? It will not be ſo with wicked men, they won't call for a Reſurrection; the ſouls of the wicked had rather their bodies ſhould ſleep perpetually, that there ſhould be no morning, that there ſhould be no Gaol delivery, rather be in Priſon than come forth to the Aſſizes; but it ſhall not be ſo with the Saints in their ſtate of ſeparation of ſoul from the body, they think long that their bodies may be raiſed from the Grave, that their ſouls may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners with them in the glory that Chriſt ſhall give out. And to ſay no more, in the</p>
            <pb n="365" facs="tcp:42593:175"/>
            <p>Laſt place, I beſeech you (with the Apoſtle) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another with theſe ſayings. Do but conſider how comfortable this Doctrin of the Reſurrection is in it ſelf; O the Reſurrection of the body, a great deal of a Chriſtians comfort is laid up in it: The Reſurrection of the body may be comfort to you in all your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that you meet withal whilſt you are in the body; in the midſt of all your infirmities and weakneſſes and troubles whilſt you are in the body: <hi>When this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſhall put on incorruption;</hi> Oh! how willingly ſhould we ſpend and be ſpent for Chriſt, becauſe he will give it all back at the Reſurrection again? How willingly ſhould we lay down our bodies, our lives for Chriſt, if Chriſt call for them, becauſe there is a Reſurrection of the body: <hi>All that the Father hath given him, it is the Will of the Father that he ſhould raiſe them up at the laſt day.</hi> It will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you when you come to lay your heads in the Grave at reſt, you ſhall not be in Priſon for ever, your bodies ſhall not lie in the dark Dungeon for ever; No, Chriſt hath taken away the horror of the Grave, and he would not have you meditate horror there; the Covenant of God, (you that are his people) holds with your bodies, where ever you are, the Covenant of God laies hold upon your ſcattered bones, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God holds with their very bones, and Chriſt will come to open thoſe Priſon doors: the Apoſtle ſaies, the whole Creation groans, <hi>Rom. 8. 22. For we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travelleth in pain together until now, waiting for that deliverance in that great day,</hi> the day of Reſurrection, the very earth ſhall travel, and it groans to bring forth, even all thoſe ſons and daughters that have lain ſo long in the bowels of the earth, even all that have been buried in the Earth and Sea, it groans to be delivered of them;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42593:176"/> and therefore what matter of comfort is this? The Lord would have you aſſured of this, That there ſhall be a Reſurrection of your bodies, he hath taught it in the Type, whilſt you have ſeen <hi>Enoch, Enoch</hi> tranſlated in the body; and he hath given you a greater confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Jeſus Chriſt, who is riſen and ſits at the right-hand of the Father: he is the ſeminal Comforter, therefore O ye Saints, be ye comforted waiting for that day of Reſurrection. And ſo much for this time.</p>

            <p>I Deſire you with patience one hour longer, then I hope through Gods aſſiſtance to finiſh that which I have been ſo long inſiſting upon, from this Text. The laſt day we enquired wherefore God took <hi>Enoch</hi> in that extraordinary manner, why was he tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death: I gave three Anſwers then. I ſhall proceed to a further Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Enoch</hi> was thus Tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee Death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was, That ſo the Lord might be a defence to that great Myſterie, even in that Generation, that he might give them a taſte, and ſo ſee of that wonderful good that God ſhould work towards the end of the world, when Chriſt ſhall come in his glory, when the bodies of all the Saints that are alive ſhall be changed, when they ſhall not ſee Death (as <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated that he ſaw not death) I ſay, here God gave ſome firſt-fruits of that wonderful work that he ſhould do for his people at his next coming, when the Saints that are
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42593:177"/> alive ſhall not die, but ſhall all have their living upon the face of the Earth, and be taken up as <hi>Enoch</hi> was, and as <hi>Elias</hi> was, even ſo ſhall they be taken up, and lifted up to meet the Lord in the Air: and here is a Myſterie which is more fully made known to us by our Lord Jeſus, ſince the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh; ſee what the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning this great myſterie of the change of thoſe at Chriſts coming, in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 51. Behold, I ſhew you a myſterie, we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trump (for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed:)</hi> Again the ſame Apoſtle doth plainly declare this myſterie to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 15, 16. <hi>For this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep. For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air: and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> He doth reveal this myſterie in all the parts of it; we that are alive ſhall not prevent them that ſleep: Chriſt ſhall firſt deſcend, and the Trumpet ſhall blow, and they ſhall be raiſed, and then ſhall we be changed.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Doth not this croſs other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures? Is it not ſaid, that <hi>it is appointed for all men once to die?</hi> Why then doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>We ſhall not all die, we ſhall not all ſleep?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Firſt of all, That this Word of the Lord is not croſt, though the Lord is pleaſed to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the ſentence: there ſhall be a kind of death to the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42593:177"/> Saints that are then alive when Chriſt ſhall come, they ſhall not die properly, there ſhall not be a ſeparation of body and ſoul: yet there ſhall be a metaphorical death, there ſhall be a change, and ſo great a change, even as death is (the change of the Reſurrection meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) which certainly is very great: and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſome fear, and ſome horror, which ſhall be even as the horror of death unto the Saints: for though there ſhall be no harm, they ſhall not be harmed when the firſt Trumpet ſhall blow, no harm to the Saints, all the woe ſhall be paſt; but yet I ſay, there may be a great deal of cauſe of fear of death, for Chriſt ſhall firſt deſcend before they be changed; and therefore there is room left for fear and horror, the Text ſaies <hi>Chriſt ſhall firſt come with thouſands, and ten thouſands of Angels, and the Trump ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall be raiſed, and all this before thoſe that are alive ſhall be changed; and then,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>we that are alive ſhall be changed, and be caught up even with them.</hi> Now Brethren, ſeeing God hath ſeen this needful, that this myſterie ſhould be revealed in all Ages, therefore a glimpſe of it muſt be given out to thoſe Generations in which <hi>Enoch</hi> lived when he was taken up: and ſo afterward the ſame was thought of <hi>Elias</hi> when he was taken up into Heaven; The Lord hath ſeen it needful, I ſay, that this myſterie ſhould be known, and if it were needful for them, then it is much more needful for us; it is needful for us upon whom the ends of the earth are come, that we ſhould know this myſterie, and that being in a continual expectation of the fulfilling of it; it is needful both for the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the inſtruction of the Saints that this myſterie ſhould be made known.</p>
            <p>For their conſolation, Why, the time is coming, when Death ſhall be ſwallowed up, when the Saints
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42593:178"/> ſhall not die, but they ſhall be changed: this change is more deſirable than death; Gods people in all Ages have longed after it, and therefore God hath revealed that there is ſuch a change to be, and that all his people might take in the comfort of it before-hand: God hath in all Ages given warning, as if it might be in that very Age; that his people might before-hand take in the comfort of it: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> declares that he and the reſt of the Saints were more deſirous to live to this time than to be diſſolved by death, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 2. We groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven:</hi> we would not be uncloathed, ſaies he, there is a kind of reluctancy in Nature to be uncloathed, to put off from the body, we had rather be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven: we had rather, if the Lord pleaſe, that a change of raiment might be given out that ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, that <hi>Mortality might be ſwallowed up of life, and that this corruptible body might put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption;</hi> Now, I ſay, it being ſo deſirable, and the Saints had rather, and are very deſirous to ſee this change, God therefore in all Ages will not conceal it but make it known (as not impoſſible it might come in that very Age in which they live) that ſo poſſibly they may take in the comfort of it before-hand: at leaſt the Saints, though they don't ſee to this day, you ſhall not be any loſers, you may die in the Faith of it, and take in the ſweetneſs of this promiſe, you ſhall be no loſers, you ſhall not be prevented, they ſhall not be in Heaven before you, with Chriſt before you, but even you that lie in the Grave ſhall be firſt raiſed, and then thoſe that are alive ſhall be changed.</p>
            <p>The Lord would alſo have you be inſtructed by this myſterie; he ſees it needful to be declared, that his people, his Saints might live in a continual expectation
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42593:178"/> of this change, this great change that ſhall be when Chriſt ſhall come again, and therefore the time was concealed that the Saints might live in a continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it, and the Apoſtle ſpeaks it as to his age, <hi>Even we that are alive ſhall be changed;</hi> becauſe the Lord would have his people in every Age to live as thoſe that do expect the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, when this great and wonderful change ſhall be: you had need alwaies ſtand upon your watch, you know not when your Lord will come, at what hour he will return from the Wedding, and therefore we had need be alwaies prepared, and ſtand with our loyns girt, and Lamps trimmed, for there is ſome dread (for a moment at leaſt) to the Saints when Chriſt ſhall come, it will be worſe if you ſhall be found ſlumbering and ſleeping in carnal ſecurity, it will be a great amazement when Chriſt ſhall come, and thouſand of thouſands of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall come with him and proclaim his glory, when there ſhall be a great cry at midnight, <hi>The Bridegroom is come,</hi> certainly it will be a great amazement even to the Saints themſelves that ſhall be in carnal ſecurity; therefore it concerns us every moment to be upon our Watch-Tower. You ſee wherefore it was that God took <hi>Enoch</hi> away in an extraordinary way that he ſhould not ſee death: there is one Queſtion yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did God take <hi>Enoch</hi> away at this time?</p>
            <p>The main Anſwer which I ſhall give, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord when he takes his people away doth thereby give warning; by taking <hi>Enoch</hi> away, That there was a deluge of wrath coming upon the old World: the Lord would put them upon it to conſider what his event ſhould be in this providence, that ſo if poſſible they might prevent that deluge of wrath, that
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42593:179"/> Flood of water that came and ſwept them away. When the Lord doth ſuddenly take away thoſe that are found faithful in their Generation, it is a warning of wrath to come: I ſay, when God doth ſuddenly ſnatch away thoſe that are found faithful in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, it doth often preſage ſome great wrath to come; you have an expreſs Scripture for it, in <hi>Iſa. 57. 1. The righteous periſheth, and no may layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous are taken from the evil to come:</hi> When God takes away righteous and merciful men, and thoſe that are left behind, do not lay it to heart, if they don't conſider it, and make uſe of it, it is a certain ſign of evil that is to come upon them. God took away <hi>Enoch</hi> in his Generation, and he took away all the reſt of the Patriarchs that are ſpoken of in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they were all taken away before the Flood of waters came upon the world; <hi>Methuſalah</hi> (he that was <hi>Enoch</hi>'s ſon) lived the longeſt, and it is thought he was taken away either that very year, or the year before the Flood came upon the old World, God ſwept away them all, even thoſe that were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Generation, and then wrath comes upon the world: <hi>O that thou wouldſt hide me in the Grave,</hi> ſaies <hi>Job,</hi> in <hi>Job 14. 13. O that thou wouldſt hide me in the Grave, and keep me ſecret until thy wrath be paſt;</hi> God hath ſome hiding places or other for his people, and ſometimes the Grave is a hiding place: though ſometimes <hi>Job</hi> doth not beſpeak the Grave, yet here ſometimes God hideth in the Grave till ſuch time as wrath be over. Such as walk with God in their Generation, they are Chriſts Flock, though they be Pilgrims and Strangers upon the earth, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers, Travellers, yet they are Chriſts Flock, here they reſt, and many times Chriſt will Fold his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42593:179"/> Flock; before a Storm comes the Shepherd gathers his Flock together: When a great Storm of Hail and Fire came upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were in <hi>Goſhen</hi> gathered all their Flocks together, and then they were ſafe; Chriſt ſhrouds the moſt of his Flock, the chief of his Flock from ſome approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath that draws near.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, They are the Lords Houſhold-ſtuff; I ſay, his people are his choice Houſhold-ſtuff, they are my Jewels, <hi>In the day that I make up my Jewels.</hi> When a man removes away all his beſt Houſhold-ſtuff, and carries away his Jewels, you may gueſs that man doth not intend to be robb'd: and ſo when the Lord doth remove his Jewels, his choice Houſhold-ſtuff, it is a ſure ſign of his departure, at leaſt God gives warning to that people, and if they won't take warning, and cry unto the Lord as they did, <hi>O why goeſt thou away and ſtayeſt for a night?</hi> And if God depart from a place, what follows, <hi>your place is left to you deſolate, and woe be to you:</hi> What a woe doth he threaten by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ. 9. 12. Woe alſo to them when I depart from them:</hi> Woe, deſolation, and ruine certainly comes upon a people when God departs from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, The righteous they are the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the place: ſuch as walk with God in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, they are the Pillars of Families, the Pillars of Cities, and the Pillars of Kingdoms, nay, they are the Pillars of the whole World: ſo ſaies the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The earth ſhook, O Lord, and I will bear up the Pillars of it;</hi> If the Pillars of the Houſe be pluckt down, how can the Houſe ſtand? If you ſee one Pillar after another fall, you will conclude certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Houſe won't hold long; Why, the Saints are the Pillars of the World, and if it were not for their
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42593:180"/> ſakes, the earth would mingle together preſently; but you muſt know this is not from any merit, worth, or righteouſneſs of theirs, though they are thus called Pillars, I ſay, it is not for any worth or righteouſneſs of the Saints, or the beſt on earth: but they are called Pillars, and they bear up Kingdoms, and they bear up the Earth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe God is intreated by their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; I ſay, they prevail, they ſtand at the gap, they prevail with God to keep out wrath and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may not break in: and ſo you know <hi>Moſes</hi> pleads with God, and ſo long as <hi>Moſes</hi> pleaded with God, God could do nothing againſt <hi>Iſrael, Let me alone that I may deſtroy them:</hi> and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> pleads for <hi>Sodom</hi> that God would ſpare that City for ten righteous mens ſakes, and God grants that requeſt: and it is very obſervable that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave over firſt, God did not give over firſt, it is like if he had gone lower he might have prevailed; but there was a holy ingenuity and faithfulneſs in him, when he conſidered, that in ſo many Cities there ſhould not be ten righteous men there, why, he could not in ingenuity ask any leſs: and ſo by their ſupplication they bear up King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, And then again, The Lord doth ſpare places and people many times, from the care that God hath of them, for the care that the Lord hath of his own people, <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the righteous with the wicked?</hi> Rather ſpare the wicked for the righteous ſake: and God doth chooſe this way, this is Gods way, he will rather ſpare the wicked for the righteous ſake, becauſe God is exceeding careful of his own people, he fears leſt they ſhould ſuffer, he will rather have the tares grow with the Corn together, than the good Corn ſhould be in danger of being pluckt
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42593:180"/> up; and therefore he tells <hi>Lot</hi> of making haſte, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. when God was about to deſtroy <hi>Sodom, Haſte thee, eſcape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither;</hi> I am ſo careful of my <hi>Lot,</hi> that I can do nothing in way of Judgement till <hi>Lot</hi> be out of fear and danger; this was not for deſert of <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteouſneſs, but the free-grace of God towards him, for it is ſaid in that Chapter, <hi>When the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him, he was merciful to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Lord ſpares (many times) evil wicked men, for the love that he bears to his own: he gives to his people the lives of others, becauſe he loves them ſo dear; ſo God gave <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 24. he gave him the lives of a great many, the lives of all that were in the Ship, which were two hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſixteen ſouls, becauſe the Lord loved him dearly: O how good is it to be with the righteous? It is good to be in their very company; one righteous man, one <hi>Paul</hi> ſaves a Ship-ful: ten righteous men may ſave <hi>Sodom,</hi> and four Cities more; and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of righteous men may ſave a Kingdom; for a few righteous mens ſakes the whole world is preſerved, that fire and wrath is not mingled in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, heaven and earth mingled in a moment, it is for their ſakes. And therefore I beſeech you, conſider and take notice of the infinite goodneſs and patience of God even to the worſt of ſinners, that he ſhould be pleaſed thus to give warning before he ſtrikes, to give warning to a ſinful Generation, by his own people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſtroy the world; O the abundance of the good patience of God! God ſeldom ſmites by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Judgement till he gives warning, it is ſad warning, and of all warnings this is a warning when God is a taking away his own people, to take them away from the evil to come: it is a ſad warning unto a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42593:181"/> people in that condition, that takes not this warning, when God is at ſo much pains and coſt with them. Therefore in the ſecond place,</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, when God gives this warning, O let us be careful to take it; it is the greateſt provocation to God when he gives warning, and we take it not: in this regard Chriſt upbraids the Scribes and Phariſees, and ſaies to them, <hi>Can you diſcern the face of the Skies, and cannot you ſee theſe ſigns? Do you ſee the ſigns there, and cannot you diſcern the ſigns of the times?</hi> Cannot you diſcern when full wrath is coming, when Judgement is a coming? Cannot you diſcern it by Gods ſigns? O how many ſigns hath God ſhewn, what abundance of his <hi>Noahs</hi> hath he Shipt? How many <hi>Enochs</hi> have been tranſlated by death? How much blood hath been ſpilt, precious blood? O that God would make it to be a warning to this Generation, that the Lord would ſtir us up too, to revive and run after him; that God ſhould give us warning, O that we could ſay, <hi>Thou hope of Iſrael, why ſhouldſt thou be as a ſtranger, and as a wayfaring man, that ſtaies but for a night, and is gone in the morning?</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Again, This upbraids the World for their former Ingratitude to the Saints, it is for their ſakes that you wicked have your lives continued, and all your comforts continued, and how is the enmity of the world let forth againſt thoſe for whoſe ſakes they are preſerved? What folly is it that men ſhould go about to pull down the Pillars of that houſe in which they dwell? It was an extream deſperate action that <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, when that he ſhould pull down the Pillars of the Houſe, and it coſt him his own life? O this is the folly of the wicked in the world that rage againſt the Saints, that pull down the Pillars; well, know of a truth, when thoſe Pillars are down, the Houſe will fall upon your
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42593:181"/> head, and to pull down theſe Pillars, will be to pull down the houſe to your own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Again, This may teach the people of God to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly, to lie down willingly in the duſt, when God ſhall call them: it is poſſible they may be taken away from a great deal of evil to come, it ſhould make them willing to lie down in the duſt when God calls; God may take you away from many an evil day that is coming, many an evil day of perſecution, and many an evil day of old age; <hi>Remember thy Creator in the daies of thy youth;</hi> through the infirmities that do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany old age, it becomes <hi>an evil day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, There's danger then of declining: O <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed, and prayed heartily, that God would not leave him to his own will, and that he would take him from the <hi>evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, There may be hopes of good daies, and that might make us unwilling to die, in hopes of good daies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, God may make you willing as <hi>Moſes</hi> was; though at the Borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet God would have him die, and he goes up to the Mountain and dies very willingly: there may be a great deal of evil before the good come, a great deal of ſhakings, ſore ſhakings before the good day come; the paſſage to the Land may be very ſtrait, yet Chriſt will bring thee along with him when he comes; I ſay, when ever Chriſt comes he will bring the Saints along with him, <hi>We that are alive, ſhall not prevent thoſe that are dead;</hi> No, they ſhall riſe firſt, and then ſhall we be changed. Therefore God took away <hi>Enoch</hi> at this time, that he may give warning to the World that wrath was a coming.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again, God took away <hi>Enoch</hi> at this time, that he might declare, that he had reſpect unto
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42593:182"/> his people, though the World was never ſo wicked, though they are never ſo cruel, yet they ſhall not be forgotten, but the Lord remembers, the Lord takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, <hi>If I find ten righteous men in Sodom,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>I will not deſtroy that City for tens ſake;</hi> God ſeeks his own people, and if he finds but ten righteous ſouls in a City, for their ſakes it ſhall not be deſtroyed, not an <hi>Enoch</hi> ſhall be forgotten: Men may caſt away much chaff, and though there be two or three Corns or more of Wheat, they won't look for them; but God won't do ſo; if a heap of chaff be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great God will look over it, and he will not loſe one Corn though in abundance of Chaff; his people do glorifie him much in an evil time, and grace is remarkable then, when it ſhines bright in the midſt of a dark night, the Lord will remember you: and therefore if the Lord will find you out, and remember you in an evil World, Oh! how ſhould you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him? He will do the more for you, and deal the more remarkably with you, becauſe you are found faithful in an evil time, in an evil World, even as <hi>Enoch:</hi> therefore be ye careful to walk with God. Again,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly and laſtly, God will declare hereby that the perfection and happineſs of his people is not here below, and therefore he would have them, and all the world to know that the perfection and happineſs of the Saints is not below: <hi>Enoch</hi> enjoyed as much of God as ever man did, and yet <hi>Enoch</hi> muſt be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated before he comes to perfection; God witneſſes to this in the lives of the beſt of the Saints in that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: there is none that lived a thouſand years, though there came many nigh to a thouſand years, which is the perfect number, the perfect account. The Lord would teach that perfection is not here, but he would have us to know where we ſhall enjoy it:
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42593:182"/> therefore let us ſee what neceſſity there is to live upon Jeſus Chriſt by Faith in the worſt of our daies; if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be not here, O what need then have you to live in Chriſt? <hi>You are perfect in him,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>compleat in him,</hi> and therefore in the ſenſe and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Imperfections, you had need live upon that fulneſs, and breath after that fulneſs of time and perfection whither <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated unto. So much ſhall ſerve for this time.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle was now in Bonds for the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: he takes care that the <hi>Philippians</hi> might not be offended at it, that his ſufferings might not be any ſtumbling-block to them, in <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. he tells them that whatſoever befell him it was for the furtherance of the Goſpel, <hi>I would have you underſtand,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>the things which happened unto me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpel:</hi> he gives two particular Inſtances how the Goſpel of Chriſt was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by his ſufferings, the one is in <hi>Verſe 13. My Bonds in Chriſt are manifeſt in all the Palace.</hi> By his ſufferings many in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court came to enquire after the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, for which <hi>Paul</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; and by enquiring into it, were convinced of it. Another benefit of theſe his ſufferings, is in <hi>Verſe 14. Many of the Brethren in the Lord waxed confident by my Bonds:</hi> They were more bold to ſpeak the Word of the Lord, they feared not ſufferings, becauſe they ſaw how God carried <hi>Paul</hi> through his ſufferings, <hi>They
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42593:183"/> waxed more bold through my Bonds.</hi> You ſee what improvement the Lord makes of the ſufferings of his people. Truth never thrives better than when it is moſt trodden upon; the more the wind blows upon this fire, the more it kindles, the hotter it burns, and the clearer it ſhines: when the ſtream is dammed up, it riſes higher, ſo it is with Truth; this was the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that God makes of the ſufferings of his people, for though the Truth was upon trial, yet <hi>Paul</hi> may ſuffer, and <hi>Paul</hi> may loſe by it, <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of his life: Well, take no care for me, ſaies he in <hi>Verſe 19. For I know that this ſhall turn to my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through your Prayers, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; according to my earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed: but with all boldneſs, as alwaies, ſo now alſo Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.</hi> Take no care for me, ſaies he, I deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your Prayers, for I am confident that God will carry on his Work, it ſhall turn to my good, and what ever befall me, the Lord ſhall be glorified in it; I am confident of it, ſaies he, that Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. You ſee the breathings of a gracious heart, it cares not what becomes of it ſelf, ſo God may have his honour, <hi>Take no thought,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paul, whether I live or die,</hi> it is all one to me, ſo the Lord Jeſus may be magnified in my bonds, by my life, or by my death, if Chriſt be glorified it is enough, it matters not what becomes of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo Chriſt be magnified in my life, or in my death, <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain. Chriſt is gain to me both in life and death;</hi> ſo ſome read the words, <hi>For Chriſt is gain to me both in life and death:</hi> Others make two Propoſitions of it, <hi>Chriſt is life to me,</hi> or, <hi>to me to live is Chriſt; Chriſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42593:184"/> is my life,</hi> and <hi>death is my gain:</hi> Why, if I live, ſaies he, Chriſt ſhall be magnified, for Chriſt is my life; if I live, I ſhall gain, and if I die, I ſhall gain: If I live I ſhall gain more of Chriſt, I ſhall gain more knowledge of him, and more communion with him here in the way; Ay, but what if <hi>Paul</hi> die? If I die, ſaies he, I ſhall be no loſer: death is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a loſs, therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>For me to live is Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>to die is Chriſt;</hi> but he rather ſaies, <hi>It is gain, it is Chriſt that makes it gain to him,</hi> or elſe it is a loſs to me, but Chriſt who is my life ſhall make death gain; So take no thought of me, ſaies he, whatſoever befalls me I ſhall do well, if I live, or if I die. And becauſe you are more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous concerning my death, ſaies he, know that <hi>death is my gain;</hi> if I loſe my friends and my comforts, if I loſe life it ſelf, it ſhall be no loſs, it ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do me, for I ſhall find all in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo death ſhall be my gain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> Chriſt is the Believers Life.</p>
            <p>That's the Propoſition that lies before us. <hi>For me to live is Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>Chriſt is my Life;</hi> it is all one: <hi>Chriſt is the life of every believing ſoul.</hi> By <hi>Life</hi> ſometimes it is underſtood whatſoever is excellent, whatſoever is excellent in its kind, it is ſet forth by life, becauſe life is the moſt excellent thing in nature, <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life;</hi> and therefore the Bread which Chriſt gives, is called, <hi>Living Bread, Bread of Life,</hi> and ſo <hi>Water of Life,</hi> for the excellency of the ſpiritual things that the Lord gives out to his people; and truly
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:42593:184"/> Chriſt is inſtead of all excellencies to a believing ſoul, he is the life of all their comforts; the comforts of the World are dead until ſuch time as Chriſt ſhines in them, there is no life until ſuch time as Chriſt ſhines through them, for riches are dead, and honour is dead, and friends are dead, all comforts are dead till the life of Chriſt be in them. But more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Chriſt is the <hi>Life of Righteouſneſs</hi> to the believing ſoul: every child of <hi>Adam</hi> is dead, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſo he is dead in Law: there is no life but by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that righteouſneſs which Chriſt brought in by his blood: He gave life by making ſatisfaction to Juſtice, by paying the debt unto death; therefore the Apoſtle ſaies, that <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs reigns by Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. ſin entered into the world by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſpeaking there at <hi>Verſe 17. For if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Righteouſneſs raigns in a believing ſoul by Jeſus Chriſt, it hath the preheminence of all, all is droſs and dung in compariſon of this righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, it reigns gloriouſly in a believing ſoul; it is Chriſt that procures this righteouſneſs, and it is Chriſt that applies this righteouſneſs by his Spirit, I ſay the Application of this life of righteouſneſs, is from Chriſt, it is he that reveals this righteouſneſs, it is he that diſcovers it to the ſoul, it is Chriſt by his eternal Spirit that cauſeth the ſoul to know this life and righteouſneſs which is given to it: now as Chriſt doth diſcover this righteouſneſs, ſo he cauſeth the ſoul to cloſe with this righteouſneſs, it is he by his Spirit that overcomes the heart to reſt upon this righteouſneſs, and to look upon this righteouſneſs as its life; for there is a principle in the creature to ſeek after life in it ſelf;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42593:185"/> man would ſeek righteouſneſs in himſelf; and it is a hard matter to bring the ſoul off of this rotten ſandy foundation; Chriſt only by his eternal Spirit when he hath revealed this righteouſneſs, perſwades the ſoul to reſt upon it, and to look upon him as its life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, As the life of righteouſneſs is from Chriſt, ſo <hi>the life of holineſs</hi> is from Chriſt: all thoſe gracious diſpoſitions, and all thoſe holy actings that do at any time ſhine forth in the hearts and lives of Gods people, they have no other foundation but Chriſt, the holineſs of Chriſt: <hi>From his fulneſs have all we received grace for grace;</hi> if there be the life of any grace in the ſoul, it is from Jeſus Chriſt, from the fulneſs of Chriſt: there is no man lives the life of holineſs, till Chriſt becomes a principle of life to him; there is no breathings in the heart after Chriſt, there is no holy motion in purſuit after Chriſt, till Chriſt firſt breaths upon the ſoul: <hi>The hour is come, and now is, that they that are in their Graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it ſhall live.</hi> There is no man lives the life of holineſs until ſuch time as he hears the voice of the Son of God: there may be Carkaſſes of grace, out-ſides of grace, and there may be Carkaſſes of duties and performances, but no living graces, there are no living performances until ſuch time as Chriſt be a principle of life unto the ſoul; the beginning of the life of holineſs, and ſo the encreaſe of the life of holineſs is from Chriſt: <hi>I came that you might have life, and that you might have it more abundantly;</hi> Chriſt decreed that you might have life, and that you might have abundance of life, that you might be filled with the Spirit of Chriſt, that you might have abundance of the life of Chriſt, that his people might be ready in his ſtrength to every good word and work; this was the end of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42593:185"/> Chriſts coming that they might have life more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; he is the life of holineſs. But again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Chriſt is the <hi>Life of Conſolation</hi> unto his people: He is the life of all their comforts, and the comforts that Chriſt gives they are living comforts: my peace I give unto you, not as the world gives, give I unto you; for no man ſhall take away your peace, the world ſhall not take it away, my Spirit ſhall be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting living principle of conſolation in you, which ſhall not be taken away: Chriſt is the life of all a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians comforts, he is the life of friends, the life of all refreſhments that a Chriſtian hath, and they are all dead to him when Chriſt doth not ſhine through them, he is the life of comforts, and <hi>the life of Ordinances;</hi> there is no life, there is no refreſhment, if Chriſt be not in them; if the ſoul meets not with Chriſt in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they are but dead Ordinances, truly Chriſt is the life of all. He is alſo,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>The Life of Glory,</hi> Chriſt is the life of glory to his people: It is he that hath purchaſed glory for them by his blood, it is he that hath made the way plain, it is he that hath made a new way to glory, when the old way was ſhut: you read in <hi>Heb. 10. 19, 20. Having therefore, Brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh:</hi> A new and living way to God, a new and living way to the boſom of the Father, it is Chriſt that is this living way: <hi>For he lives for ever to make Interceſſion for them that come to God by him:</hi> He it is that removes all the blocks out of the way of his people to glory, that helps them over all rubs they meet with, it is he that hath born down all oppoſitions, when he travelled in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, he hath ſet Heaven door
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42593:186"/> open to his people, he hath removed the Cherubims that kept the way with a flaming ſword, and kept the Tree of Life, yea, Chriſt is the ſubject matter of their Glory; it is the preſence of Chriſt that makes Heaven to be Heaven, it is the glory of Heaven to know God in Chriſt, and it is the glory of Heaven to enjoy God in Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 17. 3. And this is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> Thus you ſee how Chriſt is the life of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, what life he is to them; he is the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the life of holineſs, and the life of their comforts; yea, and he is the life of Glory. And it will appear that Chriſt is the life of the believing ſoul, if you conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That there is none lives but Chriſt, <hi>He hath life in himſelf; as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo it is given to the Son to have in himſelf:</hi> There is none lives but God: and therefore when God will confirm a thing, he ſwears by his life; you have often that Oath, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord; As I live, ſaith the Lord:</hi> there is none can ſay, <hi>I live,</hi> but only God, he that is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that hath life in himſelf. Now therefore, if any creature have life, if there be any ſpark of life in any ſoul, it muſt be from this life in Chriſt, there is no principle of ſpiritual life in a ſoul, but it muſt be from Chriſt, if there be any life, it is from the life of Chriſt, from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and from the diſcoveries of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It was the end of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, That he might give life to his people, as you heard before, <hi>I came,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>that you might have life;</hi> Chriſt came in the fleſh for this end, he had nor lived in this world, if it had not been to give life to his people, it was the end of his life, and ſo it was the end of his death alſo; he tells us in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42593:186"/> 
               <hi>If any man eat of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever: and the Bread which I will give, is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the world;</hi> I will give my fleſh, my body to be crucified, that ſo my death may be the life of the world; and it was the end of Chriſts living again, it was the end of his riſing again, that he might give life to his people, <hi>Joh. 14 19. Becauſe I live,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ye ſhall live alſo;</hi> my life is the cauſe of your living, I live for this end, and aroſe for this end, <hi>I am he that was dead and am alive, and live for ever, and becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, When may it be ſaid that Chriſt is the <hi>Life</hi> of any ſoul?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt of all, When the ſoul <hi>prizes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt as life:</hi> And mark all the way, ſo much as the life of Chriſt is in any ſoul, ſo far will theſe effects and operations of life be found in him; Chriſt is life, when communion with Chriſt is prized as life; when the ſoul ſhall prefer communion with Chriſt above all other comforts whatſoever, when he ſeeks after it as life, and when he hath found it he prizes it as life, and is as fearful to loſe it as he is to part with his life; and he cannot be ſatisfied without it, though he enjoies never ſo much of the world, though he hath never ſo many friends, and they ſhine upon him, and they ſpeak comfortably to him, yet if Chriſt ſpeak not, it doth not ſatisfie: though he hath never ſo good trading in the world, and proſper in his Eſtate, yet if he hath not trading with Chriſt, if he hath not his mercies come in through Chriſt, he looks upon himſelf as a loſer; ſo far as the life of Chriſt prevails with a ſoul, ſo far will the ſoul prize communion with Chriſt. Again,</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, When the life of Chriſt is in a ſoul, the <hi>Soul doth judge of it ſelf,</hi> not by what it is in it
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42593:187"/> ſelf, but <hi>by what it is in Chriſt,</hi> by what it is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the life of Chriſt was <hi>Paul,</hi> and how did <hi>Paul</hi> judge of himſelf, by what? By what he was in Chriſt, and by what Chriſt was in him, and to him; <hi>I live,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. how doth he judge of his life, not by any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf that was in him, but by Chriſt that was in him, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 45. 24. When he ſhall ſee that he hath no righteouſneſs in himſelf, no ſtrength in himſelf, he ſhall not judge of his preſent ſtate or future happineſs by what righteouſneſs, or what ſtrength he hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but by what Chriſt hath promiſed him, he ſhall judge by the Word of the Lord, and by what life of Chriſt is made over to him; and he ſhall ſay, <hi>Surely, I have righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> I have all in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at that time when I have nothing but vileneſs and deadneſs in my ſelf; ſo that the ſoul judges of it ſelf and its condition, not according to what it finds in it ſelf, but according to what the Lord hath promiſed to be unto him. Again,</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Where Chriſt is the life of a ſoul, there is Chriſt <hi>the principle of all holy actings in that ſoul:</hi> The ſoul when ever it ſets upon any duty, or upon any holy work, preſently it looks up for the power and ſpirit of Chriſt, it gives up it ſelf to be acted by Chriſt, to be carried on by the ſpirit of Chriſt; Chriſt opens the ſails of the ſoul to the gales of the ſpirit, for it knows that if the ſpirit of Chriſt do not breath, the ſoul is calmed, it can do nothing, it deſires that Chriſt may have the glory of all that it doth, that Chriſt may be the principle of all its workings for God; all the fruit that a gracious heart brings forth to God, it deſires that Chriſt may have the honour of it; and therefore it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42593:187"/> bears as it were upon Chriſts knee, as the women of old took their Hand-maids when they were barren, and they bare upon their knees, and the Children were called theirs, not the Hand-maids: And truly ſo the beliving ſoul alwaies bears and brings forth fruit upon the knee of Chriſt, and it calls them all the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Chriſt; whatſoever it doth for God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it brings forth to God, it looks upon it as the fruit of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; it deſires that Chriſt may have the name, that Chriſt may have the glory of it, that Chriſt may be continually lifted up in all that it doth: and therefore when it is aſſiſted to do for God, or to ſuffer for God, it doth not reflect upon it ſelf, but upon Chriſt; theſe are the breathings of the ſpirit of Chriſt, and this is the ſtrength that comes from Chriſt: and therefore it is ſaid of <hi>David, Lord what am I?</hi> when he was inabled to offer willingly, <hi>Lord what am I, and what are my people, that we ſhould offer in this wiſe?</hi> When ever it meets with any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, it ſaies, <hi>Lord what am I, that I ſhould do any thing for God?</hi> It looks upon all as coming from Chriſt, and deſires that Chriſt may have the glory of all; and ſo far as the life of Chriſt prevails upon the ſoul, ſo far the ſoul is acted by the ſpirit of Chriſt. But again,</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, Where Chriſt is the life of the ſoul, the <hi>Soul deſires that Chriſt may be magnified, whether by death or by life;</hi> ſo it was with the Apoſtle, This is all my care, ſaies he, that Chriſt may be magnified, take you no care for me, for Chriſt ſhall be magnified, and I will rejoice in it, <hi>Whether I live or die, Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body:</hi> He deſires that Chriſt may be magnified in his life, a gracious heart doth not deſire to live to ſatisfie its own luſt, it would not live long in the world to enjoy the pleaſure of the world;
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42593:188"/> no, if it lives, it deſires to live that Chriſt may be magnified, and therefore if I may be uſeful, if I may be ſerviceable to do good in any place or relation the Lord is pleaſed to caſt me in, I am content to live: and ſo for death, he deſires that Chriſt may be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there too, a gracious heart don't deſire death to be rid of the troubles of life, to be freed from thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and vexations that it meets withal in the world, that's: no good deſire, but if it deſires death, it deſires that Chriſt may be magnified, that the Lord may be magnified in my death, that Chriſt may be magnified, that I may get nigher Chriſt, that I may not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt, that that corruption may be ſubdued, which is a grief to the ſpirit of Chriſt, that I may magnifie Chriſt eternally without ceaſing: that Chriſt may be magnified, this is the deſire of a gracious heart; and ſo far as the life of Chriſt doth prevail in any ſoul, ſo far doth that ſoul live unto Chriſt, and is willing to die for Chriſt, and cares not what becomes of it, ſo the Lord, and his ſon Chriſt may be exalted. Again,</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, When the life of Chriſt is in a ſoul, <hi>It makes a man to die; to die to ſin, and to die to the world, and to die to ſelf.</hi> Where the life of Chriſt comes in, it makes the ſoul to die to ſin; that ſtill as the life of Chriſt prevails in the ſoul, ſo ſin dies in the ſoul: <hi>Knowing this that our old man is crucified with Chriſt;</hi> the old man is Crucified with Chriſt, and the life of Chriſt will be the death of the old man: He makes a man to die to ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the life of Chriſt is in a ſoul, the heart is dead to ſin, it carries to ſin, as to a dead man, it is cold at the very heart, no deſire to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh, but to live unto Chriſt; it makes the ſoul deſirous to caſt out all thoſe luſts which it hath rejoyced in, and been the very life of the ſoul
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42593:188"/> before Chriſt came. See what is ſaid in the Prophecie of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, Hoſ. 14. 8. Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> And ſo ſhall the ſoul ſay, where the life of Chriſt prevails, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> It looks upon all baſe luſts as ſo many dead Carcaſſes, they lie in his Houſe and he knows not how to be rid of them, but the life of Chriſt is in him, and what hath the living to do with the dead? What have I any more to do with dead Carkaſſes? O Lord bury them, bury them out of my ſight; the life of Chriſt will dead the heart to ſin.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again, This life of Chriſt <hi>will deaden the heart to the world;</hi> ſee what the Apoſtle ſaies in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, Gal. 6. 14. God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto me, and I unto the world:</hi> The world looks upon me as dead, and I look upon the world as dead; the world doth not at all eſteem of a gracious man, and a gracious heart doth eſteem the world as little, the vanities of the world as little; the world looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and I look upon the world as dead: <hi>Paul</hi> lookt upon it as dead, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to part with it, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12, 13. men are willing to part with their dead friends, and <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to part with the world, it was dead to him; <hi>I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound;</hi> I know how to want, if God calls for it; I know how to ſpare, and I am content to be without it; thus doth the life of Chriſt make the heart dead to the world, deadens the affections, and makes a man to uſe the world as if he uſed it not.</p>
            <p>3. Again, Thirdly and laſtly, The life of Chriſt doth <hi>make a man to die to ſelf:</hi> it makes a man to die
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42593:189"/> to ſelf-principles, and ſelf-ends, and ſelf-ſeeking, to ſelf-righteouſneſs and ſelf-ſtrength, it makes a man die to all theſe; where the life of Chriſt prevails, the creature is nothing, ſelf is nothing, it makes a man debaſe himſelf, and lie low at the foot-ſtool of the Lord, it makes him lie low in a way of humiliation: <hi>Paul</hi> was leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, ſo he calls himſelf; <hi>Leſs than the leaſt of all Saints;</hi> and he was the greateſt of ſinners, ſo he calls himſelf; the life of Chriſt made him lie low, he had no life in himſelf. I will ſpeak no more, ſaies <hi>Job, I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes;</hi> let God have all for the future, it deſires to exalt him, to admire that which he can't find out: I deſire to lye at his foot-ſtool, and to exalt his name; it makes a man lie low in a way of ſubmiſſion to God as well as in a way of humiliation, the life of Chriſt makes the heart ſubmiſſive to Chriſt, ſelf is nothing, ſelf is laid aſide, content that God ſhould rule, that the creature ſhould be diſpoſed by him, makes him willing to drink of every cup that his father puts into his hand, to ſtoop down to every yoke, and every bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that the Lord will put upon his neck, and lay upon his ſhoulder, it makes a ſoul ſubmiſſive unto Chriſt, ſubmiſſive to the Will of God in all things.</p>
            <p>And then the life of Chriſt <hi>it empties of Self,</hi> for it makes a man to condeſcend to thoſe of low degree; though never ſo high, yet if the life of Chriſt be in them, it makes them to look down unto the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the life of Chriſt in the meaneſt and loweſt Chriſtian is very high and honourable in his eſteem: and as the life of Chriſt doth prevail in any heart, ſo there will be all theſe operations, as the life of Chriſt doth increaſe, ſo the life of ſin doth decreaſe, and ſelf will decreaſe, and the ſoul is content with it, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices abundantly that it ſhould be ſo; it ſaies of it ſelf
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42593:189"/> as <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did, when they told him that all men ran after Chriſt, and he would have no Followers, I am glad of it, ſaies he, that he may increaſe though I decreaſe; and truly where the life of Chriſt is in a ſoul, it will break forth into theſe Expreſſions, Let Chriſt be all, let me be nothing, let me lie low at his foot-ſtool, let me not be thought of when that day of Chriſts Exaltation ſhall be, let him be exalted in the riches of his grace which he hath manifeſted unto poor creatures. And thus you ſee what the life of Chriſt is in a ſoul, ſo far as the life of Chriſt is in the heart, ſo far will there be ſpecial operations in the ſoul towards Chriſt again. But ſo much for this time.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>JEſus Chriſt is the Life of every Believer;</hi> that's the Point in hand: He is the life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he it is that gave life unto all thoſe that were dead, dead under the Law, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved for a time. He is alſo the life of <hi>Holineſs</hi> to his people, the beginnings of all grace, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of all grace is from Chriſt; there are ſhadows and carkaſſes of grace, but there is no life until ſuch time as Chriſt be found in the ſoul. He is alſo the life of all the Believers <hi>Comforts,</hi> they are no comforts till Chriſt be in them, the beſt of his comforts, even the very Ordinances of God are but a dead letter if the Spirit of Chriſt be not in them, it is he that makes them to be life, to come with power and efficacy. He is alſo the life of <hi>Glory</hi> to a Believer. He hath purchaſed Glory, he hath made the way plain, a new and living way, he hath ſet the door wide open, it's he that takes all rubs out of the way: It's he that is the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of Glory; for it's the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven that is the greateſt glory and comfort
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42593:190"/> of Heaven. I ſhewed how it may be known that Chriſt is the life of Believers in five Particulars.</p>
            <p>6. A Sixth Particular is, Where the life of Chriſt is in any ſoul, it makes that ſoul in ſome meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the life of Chriſt; ſo far as the life of Chriſt doth prevail in a ſoul, ſo far it makes the ſoul conformable to that life of Chriſt which he lived when he was upon earth, it makes the ſoul deſirous and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live to God: it looks upon it as the great work and great end of Chriſts coming, to lift up his Fathers Name, to make God glorious before the eyes of the ſons of men, that's the work that his ſervants have to do for him whilſt they are here upon earth. But more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, If you look upon the life, you ſhall find that the life of Chriſt is an active life, it's ſaid of him, <hi>That he went up and down doing good;</hi> he was never well but when he was doing good; he took opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he ſought opportunities, he ſought occaſions of doing good to the bodies of men, and to the ſouls of men, <hi>I have meat to eat that you know not of; it is my meat to do the will of my Father;</hi> he was never well but when he was doing ſomething by which he might glorifie God and edifie in love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Secondly, If you look upon the life of Chriſt, it was not only an active life, but it was a paſſive ſubmiſſive life, it was a ſelf-denying life. He left all his glory in Heaven when he came to live here upon earth, that he might live and die for the good of the ſons of men; though he was the ſon of the moſt high God, yet he was pleaſed to condeſcend to the loweſt of men, he emptied himſelf and became of no reputation, he was in the form of man, but yet came in the form of a ſervant, he emptied himſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of no reputation, that ſo he might glorifie his

               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:42593:192"/> Father; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> it was a ſelf-denying work. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It was a holy gracious life; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſinners, but he was the Lamb of God without ſpot; he was numbered amongſt the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, but there was no guile found in his mouth, he was gracious in the midſt of a ſinful world, and therefore the Spouſe ſtiles and reſembles him to the <hi>Apple-tree</hi> in the midſt of the Trees in the Foreſt, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. he was full of ſweet gracious fruit, even then when he was in the Foreſt, when he was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with wild Trees, as Crab-trees, Prickling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns, Prickling-brambles, even ſo was the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus amongſt ſuch: But the Lord was found in integrity, he was not levened with corruption, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſinners, yet he was no ſinner, the life of Chriſt was a gracious life, even then when he was in the midſt of ſinners. But again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The life of Chriſt was full of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and full of meekneſs; he was very admirable in that patience and meekneſs which he exerciſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his whole life; he was not eaſily provoked, for he endured alone all the contradictions of ſinners, and he was dumb even before the ſhearer, he opened not his mouth; he did not render evil for evil, <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not;</hi> What a provocation was there that his own ſhould not receive him? And Chriſt could not eaſily be provoked, he bare with that people, and though they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, yet he ſpent his whole Miniſtry among them, and he ſent forth his Diſciples to pluck them in if poſſible, and gives them a charge that they ſhould go to none elſe; in <hi>Matth. 10. 5. Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the City of the Samaritans enter ye not, but rather go unto the loſt Sheep of the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42593:192"/> houſe of Iſrael:</hi> Though they ſought to deſtroy him, yet he endeavours to ſave them, he bears with them; <hi>But rather go to the loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> What forbearance was there in him! In their ignorance he opened unto them thoſe things which he ſpake in Parables to the world; what abundance of patience and meekneſs did he ſhew to <hi>Thomas,</hi> notwithſtanding all that unbelief? Saies he, (in his unbelief) <hi>I will not believe,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>except it be ſo and ſo, except I put my hand into the hole of his ſide;</hi> and yet this did not provoke the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to leave him, but he condeſcends to his weakneſs, heals his weakneſs, and plucks him out of that mire in which he ſtuck: And if you look upon his carriage towards his enemies, and ſee what a ſpirit of meekneſs there was in Chriſt, even towards his enemies; the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in one place, would not receive him; and ſee the Diſciples they were for fire from Heaven to conſume them, in <hi>Luk. 9. 53, 54. And he ſent Meſſengers before his face, and they went and entered into a Village of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans to make ready for him, and they did not receive him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And when his Diſciples James and John ſaw this, they ſaid, Lord wilt thou, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Fire to come down from Heaven, and conſume them, even as Elias did?</hi> You think it is the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> but you are deceived, <hi>You know not your own hearts;</hi> there is a great deal of the wilde Fire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in this your motion, it's not well grounded zeal for God, therefore Chriſt ſaies, the ſon of man came not to deſtroy but to ſave them: and you know when they came to take him, in <hi>Luk. 22. 50, 51. They came with Swords and Staves againſt him: and one of them ſmote the ſervant of the High Prieſt, and cut off his right ear. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Suffer thus far, and he touched his ear and healed
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42593:193"/> him.</hi> But ſee how Chriſt bare not only with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but even with his very enemies. But again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, You ſhall find that Chriſt in his life was exceeding compaſſionate, he was not only meek and patient, but he was exceeding compaſſionate: Oh! how often did the bowels of Chriſt yearn towards poor creatures? He never ſaw an object of pity, but his heart was drawn out to relieve, in <hi>Matth. 9. 36, 37. But when he ſaw the multitude, he was moved with compaſſion on them, becauſe they fainted, and were ſcattered abroad as Sheep without a Shepherd:</hi> The very bowels of Chriſt were moved, he was filled with compaſſion towards their ſouls, nay, he was filled with compaſſion to the very bodies of men, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 14, 15, 16. he takes care that they ſhould not be ſent away faſting, but makes proviſion for them, <hi>Let them cat leſt they ſhould faint in the way.</hi> When he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a poor obſtinate ſinner, his heart was drawn out in pity: the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when ſhe came firſt, ſhe was a very jolly ſinner, ſhe laugh'd, but Chriſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied her, his bowels were towards her, and would not give her over till he made her to know that he was the true Meſſiah the Saviour of the World. When he ſaw a deſolate ſoul, his bowels were drawn forth with abundance of tenderneſs and compaſſion; as in that woman that was accuſed, thoſe that did there preſent her unto Chriſt laid a heavy accuſation upon her, in <hi>Joh. 8. 10. Jeſus lifted up himſelf, and ſaid unto the woman, where are thoſe thine accuſers?</hi> The poor creature ſat trembling at the feet of Chriſt, and ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a fearful ſentence of condemnation, but the bowels of Chriſt were drawn forth to pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>Is there no man accuſes thee?</hi> What are they all gone that accuſe thee? Well, <hi>Neither do I accuſe thee, go thy way and ſin no more.</hi> Now you ſee what
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42593:193"/> the life of Chriſt was; now I ſay, where the life of Chriſt is in any ſoul, it makes that ſoul ſome way anſwerable to the life of Chriſt in theſe particulars. It is true, the beſt of Saints come ſhort, infinitely ſhort of that which is their duty; but yet I ſay withal, that ſo far as the life of Chriſt prevails in his people, ſo far doth the life of Chriſt produce theſe operations, and it will bewail it ſelf for its unlikeneſs to Chriſt in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, If the life of Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe operations, where ſhall we find the life of Chriſt? If we look upon our ſelves we ſhall ſee ſin, and if we look upon other Chriſtians, where ever we look, there is ſo little of this to be found, that it is hard to ſay the life of Chriſt is in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I anſwer, Firſt of all, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Chriſtians do mightily come ſhort of that which is their duty, and therefore may take up a ſad complaint and lamentation, they may lament over their own hearts, and lament over one another, and bewail their caſe; but yet let not them be diſquiet, for I ſhall ſhew you, that the life of Chriſt may be in a ſoul, that is not ſo conſpicuous in all theſe particulars. In way of anſwer, if you ſay that this is the life of Chriſt, the life of Chriſt is ſcarce to be ſound in any man in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, Let me tell you, the life of Chriſt is a hidden life. It is hid from themſelves that it is not diſcerned; and as it is hid from themſelves, ſo it is hid from others, that they cannot ſee the life of Chriſt in them; and eſpecially it's hid from the men of the world, from a carnal man: there's the life of Chriſt, and the world cannot ſee it, the world cannot ſee the in-ſide of a Chriſtian, he ſees the out-ſide, but he cannot ſee the in-ſide, <hi>The Kings Daughters are all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:42593:194"/> There are ſpecial times in which the life of Chriſt is hid in a Believer, that there may be life, though it may be others may not diſcern this life. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, When God begins his work in a ſoul, the work of the Lord goes on gradually in the heart, ſtep after ſtep. You ſay <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a day; even ſo the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the beginnings of the life of Chriſt in a Chriſtian, they are very ſmall, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſcarce diſcerned; and therefore the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed, which is the leaſt of all ſeeds;</hi> Ay, but afterward it ſprings up (and you muſt not judge of the beginnings but of the latter end) the lattter end will be glorious: it is with a young Chriſtian as it is with an Infant in the womb, when it begins firſt to live there is but a little, and but a very weak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it can ſcarce be diſcerned whether it move or no, ſo is the life of Chriſt: it is like the tender plants and herbs that put forth in the ſpring, they are hardly diſcerned, hardly diſcerned from weeds, though you look upon them, though you pluck them, though you ſmell them, yet when they firſt put forth they do ſo ſmell of the earth, ſmell of the ſoil, as you cannot diſcern them: why, truly, ſo it is with the work of God upon the ſpirits of his people; look upon young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, it's hard to be diſcerned, they ſmell ſo much of the ſoil, ſo much of corrupt nature that is not yet ſubdued, that it is hardly diſcerned, but yet there is the life of Chriſt in them. And ſo</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, In a time of temptation, in them (in whom the life of Chriſt is hid) it's hardly diſcerned; and you muſt not judge of a Chriſtian in that time; I ſay, in time of temptation, for it's a time of Winter; now you know in time of Winter the life of the Tree is not diſcerned, there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42593:194"/> of life in the Tree, but yet without doubt, there is life, there's life in the Tree, the life is ſtill in the root, and it will put forth. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, A time of temptation is a time of ſwoonding: it's as a man in a ſwoond, the operation of life ceaſes, it's out of view, ye can hardly diſcern that there is life, when a man is in a ſwoond, if you look upon him you ſee no ſymptoms of life, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is changed, his lips are pale, death ſits upon him; Ay, but let a skilful Phyſician come, and he ſhall feel ſome motion of the pulſe, or ſome breathings of the noſtrils, though it be very weak, that it will ſcarce move a Feather, yet there is ſome hope: why ſo take a poor ſoul that is under temptation, he is as in a ſwoond, you ſay there is no life in him, but yet let Chriſt the Phyſician come, and he will diſcern the pulſe, and he will diſcern ſome motion, ſome movings of ſpirit, ſome breathings of heart, though it be not obvious to the view of others. Thus you ſee that the life of Chriſt is a hidden life, and therefore don't you ſay that there is not the life of Chriſt in ſuch and ſuch as profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, becauſe you ſee not thoſe operations, it may be Spring-time, or it may be Winter-time with them, or it may be a time of ſwoonding; well, notwithſtanding there is life, though thou diſcern'ſt it not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But again, Secondly, to give another Anſwer, If this be the life of Chriſt, if the life of Chriſt doth produce ſuch operation in the ſoul, when ſhall we find life?</p>
            <p>Take this Anſwer, That though the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life of Chriſt doth produce ſuch operations in the ſoul where it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the life of Chriſt is communicative to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the place that every member is ſet in; you know the ſoul being in the body, doth inform every
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42593:195"/> part of the body, and it grows, but yet every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doth not grow alike, and one member hath more ſtrength than another. Will you ſay, that the ſoul is not in the finger, becauſe the finger hath not ſo much ſtrength as the arm? Will you ſay, the ſoul is not in the foot, becauſe it hath not the ſtrength of the leg? Why thus, Brethren, it is with the body of Chriſt, all have not the ſame parts, and therefore all have not the ſame ſtrength; though the ſame ſpirit of life that was in Jeſus Chriſt doth inform the meaneſt of his members, though it doth not grow ſo big and ſo ſtrong as in other members, yet the Lord hath provided (by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation) to make up a ſweet harmony in this body, that every member ſhall have its ſtrength, and every member ſhall have its proportion, its growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, according to the place it's ſet in: that it ſhall not be ſhrunk up in the body, nor extended above what is meet, but every member in the body of Chriſt ſhall have its ſtrength, and its growth in proportion. But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, Thirdly, If you ſay that the life of Chriſt is ſuch, where ſhall we find the life of Chriſt in any if it works ſo?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, The life of Chriſt doth not work emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in every operation that is put forth in every Saint, but one Saint excels in one particular, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in another, and herein is abundance of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; I ſay, the life of Chriſt runs in ſeveral veins; in one Chriſtian it is more eminent in the vein or chanel of Faith, in another Chriſtian there is the ſame life in the vein or chanel of humiliation, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial; and in another it runs in the vein of prudence, holy wiſdom and activity, ſo that you cannot ſay, there is not the life of Chriſt in ſuch and ſuch becauſe you don't ſee an eminency in ſome particulars which it may
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42593:195"/> be you faſten upon; why, though the life of Chriſt be not eminent in that, it runs in another; in ſuch a vein as is (as it were) under ground, as is not obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thy eye, which thou ſeeſt not; nor takeſt no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Why is not every grace in its operation eminent, in every Saint, and in every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Firſt, Becauſe the Lord will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this way, a ſweet communion with his Saints: the Lord intends to maintain ſweet communion with his Saints, he therefore gives out to one, one grace more eminent, and to another, another, that ſo <hi>the eye may not ſay to the head, I have no need of thee, nor the hand to the foot ſay, I have no need of thee:</hi> So that every member ſhall have its proportion, but if you look upon the beſt Saints, you'l ſee how they come ſhort of the life of Chriſt, how defective they are in this and that particular; what need then have we to live upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs? And what need have we to keep in a continual dependance upon Chriſt, that ſo he may ſupply all our wants out of his fulneſs?</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again, The Lord doth with-hold his hand in abundance of wiſdom and goodneſs: if he ſhould give too much, he knows what poor weak creatures we are, and what poor weak veſſels we are, and if he ſhould pour in too much, he knows we were not able to bear it; <hi>If you pour new Wine into old Bottles, the Bottle will break;</hi> and the Lord conſiders that we are old Bottles, and his new Wine would break our old Bottles, we are not able to contain much, if the Lord ſhould give out much of himſelf, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Lord would break theſe old Bottles that we were not able to bear up. Chriſt tenders his people in this, that when they come to Heaven, he will fill them

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome poor ſoul will ſay, Whatſoever there is in others, I will not judge others, the life of Chriſt may be in them, and I am perſwaded the life of Chriſt is in ſuch and ſuch; I ſee the very Image of Chriſt in them, and theſe operations of life ſpoken of, I diſcern the life of Chriſt in others: But alas, I ſee nothing but deadneſs in my own ſoul, nothing but a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin and death; I ſay it's the burden of my ſoul every day I riſe, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death,</hi> I fear the life of Chriſt is not in me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not the life of Chriſt in you, Whence then are thoſe complaints that thou makeſt? Did you ever hear a dead man complain, did you ever hear him cry out of his burden? Surely there is ſome life of Chriſt, or elſe whence are theſe complaints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that body of ſin, that body of death which is more heavy to the ſoul than the burden of the Mountains? If the life of Chriſt be not in thee, whence are thoſe deſires? Thou breatheſt after Chriſt, ay, with all thy ſoul, thou couldſt even expire, that the life of Chriſt might be more manifeſt, more evident in thee; why whence are thoſe deſires? Did you ever know a dead man breath? or the Pulſe of a dead man beat? Surely theſe motions of the ſoul after Chriſt, theſe breathings of the heart after Chriſt do teſtifie there is ſomething of the life of Chriſt; but if thou canſt not find the life of Chriſt, and ſeeſt nothing but deadneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet look towards him
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42593:196"/> as a living Saviour, let thine eye be towards him as one that is ſet up to give life; he is a Tree of life for this end that is in the midſt of the Garden, and it's the Will of the Father that thou ſhouldſt come to Chriſt: thou that art ſenſible that there is nothing but deadneſs in thee; come to Chriſt for life. Chriſt complains that <hi>you will not come to me, that I may give you life;</hi> you that complain of your deadneſs, give not Chriſt cauſe to complain that you will not come to him that he may give you life; therefore ſeeing the way of the Tree of life is not ſhut up, but it's ſet open, it's left open, there is no Cherubim ſet before thee, but come and eat, eat of the Tree of life and live; Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf to thy ſoul, that thou mighteſt put forth thy hand and eat of the Tree of Life, and though thou ſaieſt thou haſt not the life of Chriſt, yet look up to Chriſt that ſo thy ſoul may have life: and know for thy encouragement, that the time is coming, and is at hand, that more of the life of Chriſt ſhall be given out than ever it was unto the Saints; I ſay, it ſhall be as life from the dead when the Jews ſhall come in again, there ſhall be a new Reſurrection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people of God ſhall differ moſt exceedingly from what they were before; the time is haſtning, and abundance of the life of Chriſt ſhall be communicated unto every member of Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Saints, they ſhall die more to ſin, die more to the world, and die more unto ſelf, and ſhall live more unto God, and lift up the Son of God, for the day of the Lord is high, and ſhall be lifted up, for in that day the Lord alone ſhall be exalted. But ſo much for this time.</p>

               <q>

            </epigraph>
            <p>CHriſt is the life of every Believer: I ſhewed you how the life of Chriſt works in every ſoul where it is, I come to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt of all, Let it be a word of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Know it's not enough to have a name to live if Chriſt be not the principle of life; it's poſſible (as I have ſhewed you heretofore) that the children of the Kingdom may be caſt out into utter darkneſs, to have a name and only a name to live, it will do men little good: therefore I beſeech you, examine whether the life of Chriſt be in you or no; whence came your life firſt? What way came into your oul that life which you have? Did it come by hearing the voice of Chriſt? That life which is from Chriſt comes into the ſoul by hearing the voice of Chriſt, in <hi>Joh. 5. 25. The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live:</hi> There is no man that lives, but he ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; can you ſay that the life
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42593:197"/> that was in you, it was thus brought into your ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was by the voice of the Son of God, it was Chriſt ſpake, Chriſt ſpake in your ſouls, and you were revived; it was Chriſt in a Promiſe, or Chriſt in an Ordinance, or Chriſt in the breathings of his ſpirit; Ay, you know it was Chriſt that ſpake, for you were ſo ſenſibly, deeply ſunk in unbelief, you were ſo dead, that if an Angel from Heaven ſhould have ſounded a Trumpet, you could not have heard, nor have believed the Goſpel. Ay, you know it was the voice of Chriſt, for you heard the ſame word many a time, the ſame promiſe was given in; you read it, you heard it, it was urged upon you, and yet you found no life in it, but when Chriſt ſpake, then your ſpirit was revived. Nay, you are perſwaded it was the voice of Chriſt, for it was at ſuch a time when you were fartheſt off from light, then was your ſpirit revived; when your condition was, thoſe dead and dry bones which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. you were furtheſt from life, when not only the fleſh was conſumed, but the bones were dry, ſcattered and conſumed, even in ſuch a ſpiritual ſenſe were you broken, and when the Word of Chriſt came to your ſoul you were revived from this Word of the Lord, and therefore certainly it was Chriſt that ſpake, I cannot but aſſent unto it: the life of Chriſt that thus comes in by the voice of the Son of God, it's Chriſt in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Again, Did not this life come in in a way of dying? I ſay, did it not come in in a way of dying? For ſo is the life of Chriſt; where the life of Chriſt is, it kills the creature, it ſtrikes him ſtark dead, the creature is nothing, it dies to ſelf, it dies to his own righteouſneſs, it dies to his own ſtrength, to his own wiſdom, have you thus found it? Thus it was
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42593:198"/> with Chriſt, the life that he purchaſed for his people, he purchaſed it by his death, it was made evident in a way of dying: when he aroſe from the Grave, then it was evident, and he is declared with power that he was the Son of God; life came in by death in a way of dying: and truly, thus it is with a ſoul where the life of Chriſt is, when Chriſt comes the ſoul dies, it ſaies as Chriſt ſaid, when he was ready to give up the Ghoſt, in <hi>Luk. 23. 46. Father into thy hands I commend my Spirit;</hi> ſo that ſoul where the life of Chriſt comes in, expires into God, the ſoul expires into God, into the hands of God, the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes nothing, it deſires to be nothing, nothing in it ſelf, content that the creature ſhould be dead, look'd upon as dead, that God alone ſhould be exalted, that he ſhould be all unto it, and that it ſhould be all in all unto him; thus the life of Chriſt, where it comes into the ſoul in this way.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, But again, Examine <hi>how your life is maintained;</hi> if the life of Chriſt be in you, <hi>How is that life of Criſt in you, that ſpiritual life maintained?</hi> the life that is from Chriſt is maintained by Chriſt, it came in at firſt <hi>by the voice of the Son of God, and ſo it's maintained by the voice of God,</hi> and every time that Chriſt ſpeaks, it's further into life, every time that Chriſt ſpeaks in a promiſe, every time that Chriſt ſpeaks in an Ordinance, it runs further into life, and every day it's dying, the life of Chriſt is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and triumphs in the victory, by killing and ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature to it ſelf in its own apprehenſion, and it's maintained by the voice of Chriſt, or by a ſight of Chriſt, ſo that where this life of Chriſt is, the ſoul in all its deadneſs runs to Chriſt; when it wants life at any time, it looks to Chriſt for it, it runs to Chriſt for this life, Lord maintain this life. A ſoul
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42593:198"/> hath its life from the Father originally, inſtrumentally from God, and it depends upon the Father for life, and where the ſoul is begotten by God, its life being in Chriſt, it's maintained by Chriſt, and it never lives ſo well as when it ſees moſt of Chriſt, it's a ſight of the glory and beauty of Chriſt, of the grace of Chriſt, and love of Chriſt that doth mightily affect the heart, and raiſe the ſpirits of the ſoul, it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſtirred up, the operations of the ſoul are ſtirred up, and it looks upon Chriſt and it's revived, it looks upon Chriſt and is ſtrengthened, and is beholding the glory and ſtrength of Chriſt, is moſt ready to act for Chriſt, and to work for Chriſt, whenas the ſoul hath much of Chriſt in his eye. Well, is your life thus maintained? certainly this is the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. But if I would ſpeak in a way of diſcovery unto poor creatures that are without the life of Chriſt: It will be an eaſie Teſt unto the diſcovery of many that they are without the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>How many poor creatures in the world death ſits on their ſore-heads, upon their faces! Chriſt is not their life, but the world is their life, and their luſts is their life, and the creature is their life, for they live upon theſe, the life of many a poor ſoul is bound up in theſe, his life is bound up in the world, and bound up in his luſts, and if the world be taken from him, or his luſts taken from him, he cries out, O he is undone, what hath he more? And what will God do him good, or Chriſt do him good, or communion with the ſpirit do him good? his luſts are his life, and his life is taken away when he is robbed of his luſts. When a man doth live to the ſatisfaction of his luſts, and makes them the whole end of his living, not to lift up God and Chriſt, but to live to the ſatisfaction of the luſts of his heart, I ſay, here it is an eaſie matter to ſay without breach
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42593:199"/> of the law of love, the Lord be merciful to ſuch poor creatures, for the life of Chriſt is not in them, they lay rotting in their Graves of ſin, their throat is an open Sepulchre, there's no appearance of the life of Chriſt in ſuch. And therefore I ſhall deſire the Lord would convince ſuch poor creatures, how miſerable their condition is without the life of Chriſt: they are like ſo many dead Carkaſſes, and what a ſad object is that, to look upon ſo many men as dead carkaſſes though they be never ſo lively, never ſo full of ſtrength, activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of beauty here before the eye of the World, yet in relation to the inviſible World, which is many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more conſiderable, ſuch men are as dead carcaſſes, I ſay, in the eye of God and of his Angels, and the reſt of the Inhabitants of the inviſible World, ſuch poor creatures are as dead carkaſſes, as dreadful an object to them, as a walking Ghoſt is to you: a carkaſs that lies rotting in the Grave where there is nothing but putrefaction, it is a noyſom, an offenſive object, every one turns away from it; and truly every one is ſuch, who is a ſinner, an obſtinate ſinner, the Lord cannot away with them, that if they continue in treſpaſſes and ſins, being dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, the Lord will bury them out of his ſight, there wants nothing but a burying them out of the ſight of God to make their miſery compleat; reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the preſence of God, to be caſt out of the ſight of God, and his preſence for ever, never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face in glory, and communion with him, it ſhall be the completion of the miſery of ſuch poor wretches: And therefore I ſhall deſire you in the fear of God to look after the life of Chriſt; O that the Lord would perſwade you to look after the life of Chriſt, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life;</hi> Look after
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42593:199"/> Chriſt for life; O that you would conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the life of Chriſt, is it not worth the ſeeking after? Shall I ſet it out to you, by comparing the life of Chriſt with natural life, which is accounted moſt excellent in this lower world, and you ſhall ſee how infinitely excellent the life of Chriſt is? What is the moſt excellent thing in the World, the beſt thing in nature? Why life, natural life is the beſt thing in nature; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life:</hi> the leaſt worm is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Sun in that reſpect, becauſe it hath life, life is moſt excellent in its nature: But now compare the life of nature with the life of Chriſt, and you ſhall ſee how far it goes beyond it, and therefore infinitely more deſirable than the life of nature. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, The life of Nature is <hi>a vain life,</hi> a life full of vanity: <hi>Eve</hi> was convinced thereof by that time ſhe brought forth a ſecond Son, ſhe called his name <hi>Abel,</hi> that is vanity; ſhe now knew that was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and caſe of the ſons and daughters of fallen man, of all ſhe brought forth, with all the world that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, their lives ſhall be vanity, <hi>Man walks in a vain ſhadow, in a vain ſhew,</hi> Pſal. 39. 5, 6. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every man walks in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in vain: the life of Nature is full of vanity, it appears in that it ſatisfieth not; it is empty and vain, for it proves many times a burden, even vanity: life it ſelf, which is the moſt excellent thing in nature, it proves a burden if you declare the vanity of it: and ſo many times it is ſo to the wicked, and to the Godly. Life is a burden to the wicked: there is a principle in nature in a man to live, to deſire to live, to live alwaies, and yet man many times is weary to live; the wicked man would live long, and yet his life is a burden, he would live longer, he never dies willingly, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42593:200"/> he be the inſtrument of his own deſtruction, he dies not willingly; It is ſaid of the wicked man, <hi>That be ſhall not live out half his daies;</hi> Why, though they may live longer than the righteous, though he live a hundred years, yet he may not live out half his daies, he deſires to live long, and yet life is a burden to him, here is a vanity: eſpecially when the Lord ſhall break in upon his ſoul with apprehenſions of wrath, and when he meets with vexations and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the world, many times he ſpeaks againſt his life, and acts againſt his life, which is a great ſin: here's a vanity.</p>
            <p>Nay, natural life is a burden many times to Gods own people; you may ſee how it comes ſhort of the life of Chriſt, though it is the moſt excellent thing in nature, yet it is a burden to the Saints; the corruption that is within their own hearts, which doth follow them all the time of life, makes life a burden: <hi>O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death?</hi> The workings of corruption have made his very life a burden to him, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from it? And ſo through the temptation of Satan the life is made burdenſome, through the evil of the times, through the diſhonour that is brought to God in the world, whilſt they look upon it their life is made a burden to them; <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteous ſoul was vexed, his life was a burden to him: though they dare not think againſt their lives, and act againſt their lives, yet many times life is a burden to Gods own people, not but that they are willing to bear their burden whilſt God is pleaſed to let them live here. But now,</p>
            <p>Turn your eye to Chriſts life, and you ſhall ſee the life of Chriſt is full of ſatisfaction, full of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It's full of ſatisfaction, you don't ſay of that as ſometimes <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his life, you may ſee in <hi>Job</hi> 7.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42593:200"/> 15, 16. he was under ſore temptation, and in great affliction, <hi>I loath it, I would not live alway;</hi> why <hi>Job</hi> never ſaid ſo of the life of Chriſt, he never ſaid of that, <hi>I loath it, I would not live alway;</hi> No, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a gracious heart ſaies thus, I love it, I delight in it, I would live alway, let me live to Eternity, to lift up the name of God, to behold his Glory, to wait at his foot-ſtool, to extol his glorious name for ever and ever; thus you ſee how contrary the life of Chriſt is unto the life of nature, in reſpect of the vanity of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But again, Secondly, The life of Nature is <hi>a ſinful life,</hi> and that makes it worſe than vanity; ſin doth accompany it all along, yea in its firſt riſe, in its firſt being, <hi>In ſin was I conceived,</hi> ſaies <hi>David.</hi> A man that hath nothing but the life of nature lives to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to ſin: he lives to diſhonour God, he lives to wound and to deſtroy himſelf, he lives to do hurt in the world, in injury to others; and theſe are the fruits that nature brings forth: but the life of Chriſt is pure and holy, it's without ſin, there is no principle of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in it; and therefore it never dies, it never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, it hath no principle of corruption in it ſelf, but it is pure as the life of God is pure. But again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The life of Nature is <hi>a miſerable life;</hi> it's full of miſery; ſee how <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of it, ſpeaking of the life of Nature, he ſaies, <hi>That man is born to miſery as the ſparks flie upward,</hi> that is, Naturally: the ſparks naturally flie upward, and ſo there is all the portion that a man is born unto by nature; if he hath any beſides his miſery, it's beſides his portion, he hath more than he was born to, for he was born to miſery: But the life of Chriſt hath no ſorrow in it, for he that is born again to God, is born to happineſs, he is born to joy, he is born to glory, even <hi>as the ſparks flie upward;</hi> this is the portion that he is born
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42593:201"/> to, and if he comes ſhort of this, it's accidental, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he comes ſhort of the life of Chriſt, if he comes ſhort of this glory and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he comes ſhort of the life of Chriſt, for the life of Chriſt ſhall be compleated in Heaven, where it ſhall not be interrupted in its actings, then there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; there ſhall be then no ſorrow, for all tears ſhall be wiped away: this is the excellency of the life of Chriſt. Again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The life of Nature is <hi>a decreaſing life:</hi> it decreaſes as ſoon as ever it comes into the world, as ſoon as ever a man begins to live, <hi>He comes up, and is cut down like a flower:</hi> The Candle conſumes as ſoon as it is lighted: and even thus is the life of Nature; and it's like a Garment that is eaten with the Moths; it's continually decreaſing and waxing worſe and worſe. There are ſo many worms at the root of the Tree, gnawing at the root of our Tree, that as ſoon as ever we ſpring above ground, our natures decreaſe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the life of Chriſt is an increaſing life, there is a period beyond which a Chriſtian ſhall not grow, he doth not come to his height, and then go downward, there is no period in his growth ſo long as he is on this ſide Heaven, there is no old age in which his life decreaſeth; it's true, the operations of life may be deſtroyed in a Chriſtian, but the principle of life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes continually: and therefore the promiſes are made that they ſhall be as Trees which <hi>bring forth fruit in old age;</hi> and <hi>that they ſhall grow from ſtrength to ſtrength, until they come to appear before him in Sion;</hi> and thus in the ſtrength of Chriſt they ſhall go from ſtrength to ſtrength, which is far more excellent than the life of Nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But again Fifthly, The life of nature <hi>is an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life:</hi> there is no man hath any leaſe of life, but
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42593:201"/> our times are in the Lords hand, and there is no man living hath certainty of life for a moment: It's true, the Fool in the Goſpel makes large promiſes, and makes a large leaſe to himſelf of that which was not his own, he would leaſe our life for years, for many years, but he reckoned without his Land-lord, and you know that that night his ſoul was taken from him. Of all things in the world, life is the moſt uncertain thing, but the life of Chriſt that Chriſt gives is moſt certain, it is a life that cannot be taken away: it is as ſure to a Chriſtian as the life of Chriſt in Heaven is ſure, a Chriſtian can no more die than Chriſt can die, <hi>Becauſe I live,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ye ſhall live alſo;</hi> as ſure as I live, ye ſhall live alſo; as my life is certain, ſo your life alſo is certain; for <hi>your life ſhall no man take from you.</hi> Though there be many that ſeek to take away a Chriſtians life, yet none ſhall be able to do it. 1. The <hi>World</hi> ſhall not rob them of life, <hi>Be of good comfort I have overcome the world,</hi> ſaies Chriſt. 2. Sin is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemy to the life of Chriſt, but yet it ſhall not prevail. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law but under grace;</hi> there's the bond of the Lords faithfulneſs. Again, 3. <hi>Satan</hi> is another enemy to the life of Chriſt, but he ſhall not prevail neither, <hi>Chriſt hath ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, and hath triumphed over them;</hi> for it is ſaid, the <hi>Lord Jeſus ſhall tread down Satan under your feet ſhortly,</hi> that the life of Chriſt ſhall not be taken from you; here is the excellency of it. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, The life of nature <hi>is a deceitful life,</hi> both for time and continuance, and alſo for the comforts of it; it promiſes a great deal but performs little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: riches, and honour, and pleaſures, and the reſt of the good things of natural life; it promiſeth much but performs little: but when the creature comes
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42593:202"/> to experience, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, why, he is deceived, deceived in his expectation, for he finds nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit: let a man try, if he will, he ſhall never find ſo much comfort as it promiſeth him; but the life of Chriſt is no whit deceitful, it doth not promiſe more than it performs, there is alwaies more found in the enjoyment of the life of Chriſt than was promiſed, and more than the ſoul did ever expect; how often doth the poor ſoul cry out (with the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>) that is taken up into the Mount and ſees Chriſt transfigured; Do but behold a little of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe cries; behold there was no ſpirit left in her when ſhe ſaw <hi>Solomon</hi>'s houſe, for ſhe did not believe what was told to the half of what ſhe ſaw; Why, ſo when the life of Chriſt is given out to the ſoul, you ſhall find more than ever was told; God will be more and better in the performance than he was in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and truly, the life and glory of Chriſt is <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible</hi> in reſpect of the creature, the largeſt capacity and underſtanding, though inlightened and ſanctified, is not able to take in the leaſt part of the glory of the life of Chriſt, it's not able to comprehend the notion of it, much leſs the life it ſelf, the great diſcoveries of it ſhall be reſerved for heaven, and then it ſhall be found of all Saints that the life of Chriſt was not like the life of man, there was no deceitfulneſs in it. But to ſay no more:</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, The life of Nature <hi>is a momentany life;</hi> therefore often compared in Scripture to things that are not, or are gone in a moment; the breath, the ſhadow, the wind that paſſeth away, there's no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, it comes up and is cut down: there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance compared with Eternity, it's but a moment, the longeſt life is but a paſſage, there's no ſtay, it's but a Bridge to go over, it's but a Bridge to Eternity; life is but a moment, but now the life of Chriſt is an eternal
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42593:202"/> life, the life that Chriſt gives to the ſoul is eternal, he that lives in Chriſt, and with Chriſt, ſhall live for ever, it ſhall never be taken away, it ſhall never be blown out, but the ſoul that hath the life of Chriſt, ſhall live as long as Chriſt lives, it can no more die, than Chriſt can die; now he died but once, and being riſen from the dead, he can die no more, but he lives for ever and ever; and thus is the life of Chriſt when ever it is communicated to a ſoul, that ſoul can die no more, it hath died when Chriſt died, and therefore ſhall die no more, but it ſhall live, it ſhall live even to Eternity, and to Eternity it ſhall lift up the name of God and Chriſt. You ſee how excellent the life of Chriſt is, how far it ſurpaſſes the life of nature; every man deſires to live, and to live long, becauſe the life of nature is apprehended to be excellent; but you have ſeen what a poor life it is without the life of Chriſt: it's a poor, vain, ſinful, miſerable, wretched, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, uncertain, deceitful, momentany life: O that that which hath been ſpoken of the life of Chriſt, might ſtir up all your hearts to enquire the way of life, that you may ſit and wait at the foot-ſtool, and wait for the givings out of his life, for he came to this end that you might have life, and that you might have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>

            <p>DOCT. <hi>Chriſt is a Believers Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat's the Propoſition in hand: I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Doctrinal part the laſt day, and I made Application. I put you upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, to ſee whether the life of Chriſt be in you or no: It is not enough to have a name to live, for many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs; and therefore you that have a name to live, examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Chriſt your life or no. But to proceed by way of Inſtruction,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let us take notice, in the third place, of the excellent ſtate of every Believer; I ſay, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the excellent ſtate of every Believer that is made partaker of the life of Jeſus Chriſt. If the life of nature be ſo excellent, and makes the creature
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42593:203"/> ſo excellent in its kind, why then how excellent is this life of Chriſt, which is communicated and made over unto his people? I ſay, the life of nature is ſo excellent, as that the leaſt worm that creeps upon the earth, is of more noble account than the Sun in the Firmament; the moſt inanimate creature in all the world is worth the Sun, in reſpect of its life; truly, the meaneſt of Saints, he that is leaſt in his own eye, and it may be, in the eye of the world, he is moſt excellent in the eye of God, in the eye of Saints and Angels; I ſay, in the eye of the inviſible world, he is more excellent than the greateſt man on earth, that ſhines with the greateſt worldly glory that can be, for why? this little worm hath life, this worm <hi>Jacob</hi> hath life; whereas a natural man is dead, and without life; in <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 4. A live Dog is better than a dead Lion;</hi> Why, Brethren, it is true in this ſenſe alſo; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan</hi> knew ſhe was called Dog, and ſo ſhe was in reſpect of her outward condition, for ſhe was one of the out-caſt Gentiles, a ſtranger to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not worthy to eat of the crumbs of the Table; but though ſhe was a Dog, ſhe was a living Dog, and though a Dog, yet ſhe was accounted by Chriſt far better than the great Rabbies of the World, ſhe was a living Dog, though they were but dead Lions, and ſhe ſhall ſhine in the Firmament, whenas the dead Lions of the World ſhall rot and their carcaſſes; the living Shrub that ſhall grow and flouriſh, when the dead Oak ſhall be cut down and made fuel for the fire. And therefore, I beſeech you Brethren, that you would learn by this how to judge of your ſelves, and how to judge of others, and not according to that mean condition that (happily) God hath caſt you in, in the World; but by that principle of life which is within you: if Chriſt be your life, if Chriſt be in
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42593:204"/> you the hope of Glory, why, though in reſpect of your natural life and outward accommodations, your life is but as the life of a worm, yet your ſpiritual life being in you, is a life better than the life of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which is a ſpark of the life of Chriſt himſelf, of God himſelf; which though their life be hid, it's hid with God in Chriſt, <hi>And when Chriſt who is your life ſhall appear, then ſhall you alſo appear with him in Glory;</hi> and therefore notwithſtanding all thoſe hinderances of Clouds in the World that are caſt upon you, yet know that this your life is hid with Chriſt in God. So much by way of Inſtruction.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. A word of Exhortation, And firſt of all I ſhall ſpeak unto ſuch as are ſtrangers unto the life of Chriſt. And Secondly, To thoſe in whom Chriſt is a principle of life.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, To thoſe that are ſtrangers to the life of Chriſt. My deſire and requeſt is, That the Lord would cauſe you to come to Chriſt for life, the Father hath made him the principle of life unto all that ſhall live in his ſight; you that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, that it may be eaſily ſeen and ſaid of you, that the World is your life, and that your luſts are your life, that your life is bound up in creatures, and not in Chriſt; I beſeech you, that you would this day come to Chriſt that he may give you life; know it, that the Lord doth this day tender life to you, the Lord Chriſt ſtands weeping over you in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as ſometimes he wept over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in <hi>John 11. 35. Jeſus wept.</hi> And truly I may ſay, Chriſt ſtands weeping over you; poor ſinners that are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your treſpaſſes and ſins, the Lord Chriſt ſtands weeping over you, he ſounds forth this Word, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life: know that you are in a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42593:204"/> dead ſleep; ſuch as are ſtrangers to the life of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are like men in a ſleep; they are filled with fancies and dreams, and conceits, that they have life and ſtrength, righteouſneſs and glory, they dream of a Feaſt, but when they awake they are hungry; thou conceiteſt thou art Rich, and ſtand'ſt in need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art poor, miſerable, blind and naked: now it is to you that the Lord ſaies, <hi>Ariſe, awake thou that ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;</hi> it is high time we ſhould awake, the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>The night is paſt, the day is at hand, and therefore it is high time that men ſhould awake;</hi> there is a glorious day that the Goſpel ſhall now ſhine, in which the Lord makes gracious diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of himſelf; light ſhines round about you, and therefore awake thou that ſleepeſt: It is a ſhame for men to lie a bed Sleeping and Snorting when the Sun ſhines on their faces, and calls them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: what a ſhame is it for men to lie aſleep in the day of the Goſpel, when the Sun hath riſen and viſited our coaſts? O know! the Lord bids thee to awake, and ſtand up from the dead thou that ſleepeſt; I beſeech you, be not found amongſt the dead; when God ſhall find you amongſt the dead, for him then to caſt you among the dead, and bury you out of his ſight, caſt you for ever out of his ſight to Eternity; O let this awaken your ſouls, when God calls you to awake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, If we be dead men, why do you ſpeak to us? Can the dead ariſe? Can the dead hear the voice? Why do you bid us ſtand up and awake, if we be as dead men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, It is true there is no principle of life in a natural man: the Lord doth not ſpeak to you, becauſe you have a principle of life in you,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42593:205"/> he doth not ſpeak to you, becauſe you have life in you, but he ſpeaks that ſo you may live, he ſpeaks that ſo he may convey life to you, for you muſt know that the Lord Jeſus is the Prince of life, he is the Lord of life, he can command life, he gives life by his Word, he gives life by the breath of his mouth; and therefore know it is not an empty word, when the Lord calls upon you to live and to ſtand up, for he that ſpeaks to you is the Lord of life. When Chriſt ſpake to <hi>Lazarus, Come forth,</hi> he knew <hi>Lazarus</hi> had no power of himſelf to come forth, but when he ſpeaks, he gives life to <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and enables him to live, and to ariſe, and ſo he comes out of his Grave; Why, ſo it is, the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks and call upon you to live, and he will give you life: it is the prerogative of God, he calls things that are not, as if they were; he ſpeaks to dead men as if they were alive; and when the Lord ſpeaks he acts upon the ſoul; there is an effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Spirit of Chriſt that goes along to the giving of life to every ſoul that belongs unto God by the Word of the Lord. If a man go to a heap of Wood, and he commands the Wood to burn, he may command long enough before he ſhall ſee any ſuch effect upon it; but if this man take fire in his hand, fire in one hand, and bellows in the other, and lay fire to the wood, and blow upon the fire, he ſhall preſently ſee it ariſe up to a flame: And thus the Lord ſoeaks, his Word is not an empty Word, but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries fire along with it: when he ſaies, O ſoul live! O ſoul be inflamed with deſire after it! this is not an empty word, but there is efficacy goes along with it, the Lord pours out (going along with it) pours out a ſpirit of burning, and breaths upon the ſame Word, with command that ſparks be blown up to a
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42593:205"/> mighty flame; ſo that the Lord ſpeaks, and when he ſpeaks, his words are not in vain; when he ſpeaks that he would have you to live, do not you make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the life of Chriſt, do not ſay we are dead creatures, how ſhould we live? Conſider what <hi>Abraham</hi> did; it is ſaid, <hi>He conſidered not his own body, when it was dead, neither the deadneſs of Sarahs womb;</hi> he did not look upon it, in <hi>Rom. 4. 19. Not being weak in Faith;</hi> it is ſaid he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not his own body now dead, dead as to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor the deadneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, but he eyed the Word of the Lord, the faithfulneſs and truth of God in his Word, he lookt to the all-ſufficiency of that God which had promiſed, he knew that he was able to perform what he had ſpoken, though it ſeemed never ſo unlikely unto ſenſe, therefore <hi>he ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief, but he was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God:</hi> and ſo alſo you poor creatures, do not look ſo much upon your own dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but know that God can out of very ſtones raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> he can quicken thee by the Word of his mouth, and the breath of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils: though thou lieſt before him as <hi>Adam</hi> did, who was as a lump of clay, liveleſs and uſeleſs, but the Lord made a body thereof, and made it to become a living body; though thou art dead, the Lord can breath life in thee by the Word of his Spirit, and ſo it ſhall burn unto Eternity; all the life and breathings, and motions of the Spirit after the Lord, theſe are kindled by the Spirit of the Lord: therefore look not ſo much after thine own deadneſs, but look to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of him that hath promiſed, that thou maiſt not ſtagger at the Promiſe through unbelief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But I am not only without the life of Chriſt, ſaith ſome poor guilty ſinner, but I have
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42593:206"/> been an enemy to the life of Chriſt, I have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the life of Chriſt both in my own ſoul and others; I have ſmothered thoſe motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he hath often caſt in, I have perſecuted the appearances of the life of Chriſt in others, and the Lord cauſe me to lie under the apprehenſion of the guilt of it, and now I am ready to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I am caſt out of ſight, the time of life is paſt, and the Lord hath for ever excluded me, and ſhut me under death, darkneſs and horror; I ſhall not ſee the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why even to thee let me ſay that eternal life is the free gift of God, I ſay, this life is the free gift of God, there is no gift more free than this life which God doth impart unto poor ſinners: It was ſaid <hi>when Chriſt aſcended up on high, he led Captivity Captive, and he received gifts for men, even for the rebellious alſo, that God might dwell amongſt them:</hi> Chriſt received life for Rebels, he received gifts for Rebels, and this was not the leaſt of gifts, this was the greateſt of gifts that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for Rebels, this gift of life: and therefore you ſhall ſee how Chriſt gave life unto that evil generation that did ſo perſecute him even to the very death; though they cut him off from the Land of the living, as not being worthy to live among them, yet to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were the chief actors, the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Crucifying of the Lord of life, there was life given them; as we may ſee by thoſe that were converted at <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the death of Chriſt and life of Chriſt; the Apoſtle tells them in <hi>Acts 2. 23. He was delivered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledge of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him ye have taken, and by wicked hands have Crucified and ſlain:</hi> And afterwards in that Chapter
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42593:206"/> you ſhall read that even thoſe he ſpeaks to here, at Verſe 37. were converted, life was diſpenſed to them, pardon to them, mercy to them, grace to them, even to them that had with wicked and cruel hands ſlain and crucified the Lord of life and glory; and therefore alſo Chriſt ſaies in <hi>John 6. That he came to give his life for the World; he gave his fleſh for the life of the world;</hi> the world that lay in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that was in darkneſs, that was filled with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Chriſt, and againſt his people whilſt they were here in the world; Chriſt gave his fleſh to be life unto the world, therefore ſee that eternal life is the gift of God: he gives it ſo freely to Rebels, to ſuch who had their hands embrewed in his blood, that had with wicked hands crucified and ſlain him. See what a door of Hope is ſet open for poor guilty ſinners that they may come in and be made partakers of this life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be that ſoul will further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay; I have not only been an enemy to the life of Chriſt, but I have continued ſo long dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, that when I look upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it ſeems unto me like unto the ſtate of dead and dry bones, and I am ready to ſay, Is it poſſible that ſuch dead and dry bones ſhould live, that have lain ſo long in the Grave of ſin, ſo long rotting and ſtinking in their luſts, is it poſſible that ſuch ſhould live?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let me tell you That the Lord carries on his work, though under great diſadvantages; that Parable or Viſion that was repreſented to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concerning the Jews, is very remarkable, in <hi>Ezek. 37. 3. And he ſaid unto me, Son of man can theſe bones live? And I anſwered, O Lord, thou knoweſt;</hi> Go Propheſie upon them, and the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42593:207"/> Lord ſaies then he would give life unto them: I know no way how they ſhall live, it is beyond the reach of the creature to know, thou art infinite in wiſdom and power, O Lord thou knoweſt the way how to give life and being to them; Well, ſaies God, they ſhall live; the Lord often gives life to ſuch poor creatures in ſuch a condition when they are like unto dead and dry bones, when furtheſt from life: the skin was not only broken, and the fleſh conſumed, and the bones looſned and disjointed, but they were ſcattered abroad, broken and dry, and ſo they were in ſuch an eſtate as was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off from life, but even then the Lord delights to communicate life. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> had lain four daies in the Grave, then the Lord Chriſt raiſed him up, he could have raiſed him as ſoon as his breath had gone out, but the Lord Chriſt let him go four daies, when he ſeemed to be fartheſt off from life, when his ſiſter had ſaid, <hi>Lord by this time he ſti keth;</hi> ſaies Chriſt unto her, <hi>Did not I tell thee, if thou wouldeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> What ſaies Chriſt to the poor ſoul, when the ſoul ſaith, Lord I have lain ſo long ſtinking in my luſts, and how is it poſſible I ſhould believe? <hi>Have not I told thee</hi> (as he ſaid to <hi>Martha) that if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhalt ſee the glory of God,</hi> the glory of his Power and the glory of his Grace, to give life to theſe dry bones? So ſay I to you, notwithſtanding all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, go and wait upon the Lord, and ſit at the foot-ſtool of Chriſt and wait for the giving out of life, and know that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The hour is come when they that are in their Graves ſhall hear the voice of the ſon of God and live:</hi> Sit down at Chriſts foot, and wait to hear his voice, hearken diligently when Chriſt will ſpeak, and what Chriſt will ſpeak to thy ſoul, for certainly the hour is come when ſuch as are
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42593:207"/> in their Graves ſhall live: wait for the voice of Chriſt, and wait for the pourings out of the Spirit of Chriſt, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of faith that may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry up thy ſoul to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and know that he is the Reſurrection and the Life, and though thou beeſt never ſo dead in thy ſelf, yet by faith in Chriſt thou ſhalt live. Thus much to thoſe that are ſtrangers to the life of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let me ſpeak a word to thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. If Chriſt be your life, then I beſeech you, that you would live upon Chriſt, fetch life from Chriſt, let it appear to all the world that Chriſt is your life; let it appear in all your actings, in your converſings with God, and in your converſations in the world. O that you would make Chriſt your life! What a ſhame is it that Chriſtians ſhould live no more upon Chriſt? ſee that you look unto him as your life, as your life of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as your life of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as the life <hi>of all your Comforts,</hi> as the life of <hi>all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi> live upon Chriſt, upon the ſtrength of Chriſt in all your works, and in all your duties: it's a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed frame of ſpirit when the ſoul can ſay as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did, in <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I live,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> When a man can ſay it is I, and yet not I, it's Chriſt that lives in me, it's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt that ſpeaks in me, and it's the ſtrength of Chriſt that acts in me, it's the arm of Chriſt that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports me, and it's the wiſdom of Chriſt that guides me: it's no more I that live, it's not I that work, but it's the Spirit of Chriſt that doth all this in me, and for me: why then I fear we are debtors to this exhortation, and what a ſhame is it that we ſhould live ſo little upon Chriſt, that we ſhould live ſo much upon the creature, and ſo much upon ſelf? Truly,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:42593:208"/> the Lord may take up a complaint againſt moſt of this Generation, as ſometimes he did againſt his people <hi>Iſrael; Theſe people had committed two great evils, they had forſaken me the fountain of living water, and digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns:</hi> To go for the living amongſt the dead, to live ſo much upon creatures, to live ſo much upon outward things, for a Chriſtian to have his life bound up in them, ſo as he knows not how to live without them; and ſaies, if I loſe ſuch a comfort, and am deprived of ſuch a relation, O I am undone for ever; what a diſhonour is this to Chriſt, and to that principle of life that is in you? That your life ſhould be bound up in any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: know that a Chriſtian cannot be undone; ſo long as Chriſt lives he lives, Chriſt can die no more, and therefore his life cannot be put out; the life of his righteouſneſs, and the life of his comforts ſhall not die, they ſhall be put out no more than the life of Chriſt is. Therefore let me deſire that you would look to Chriſt for an abundance of life, I ſay, look to Chriſt for abundance of life: it is not enough that Chriſt be a principle of life in you, but a Believer ſhould look to Chriſt for abundance of life, it was the end of his coming, <hi>I came that they might have life,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and that they might have it more abundantly:</hi> Chriſt came that his people might have abundance of life, and therefore do not ſtraiten your ſelves, be not ſtraitened in your own bowels, when you are not ſtraitened in Chriſt, you are not ſtraitened in your principle, <hi>With thee is the fountain of life,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and therefore in thy life we ſhall ſee life:</hi> The fountain of life is in Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is abundance of life for all Believers; there is no man need to make ſpare of the fountain head, if a man be owner of a fountain, ſurely he need not
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42593:208"/> make ſpare, he may drink abundantly, hearty draughts, and not to ſip when he hath a fountain to go to: with Chriſt is a fountain of life, he is a fountain, and <hi>a fountain ſet open;</hi> therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you go to Chriſt for abundance of life, let all your actings be proportionable to that principle of life that is in you: What a ſhame is it that we ſhould have a living head in Heaven, I ſay, a living head, and that we ſhould be ſuch dead members? O that the Lord would cauſe all our ſouls to look unto this Fountain, that ſo we may be filled and ſatisfied. What do you more than others? ſaies Chriſt unto his people. There is ſome ſingular thing that Chriſt expects his people ſhould do, they have a principle above others, and therefore their actings ſhould be above others; the life of a Chriſtian or a Believer, is as much above the life of the natural man, as the life of man is above the life of beaſts, or the life of a Tree or a Plant; and therefore the operation of their life is far more excellent: what a ſhame is it that it ſhould be ſaid of a Chriſtian, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the life of Chriſt, what do they more than others? Wherein do they differ from the World? What difference betwixt them, and thoſe that have their portion in this life? O my Brethren, if Chriſt be your life, then let all the breathings, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your ſpirits be high, noble, and lifted up, let them be carried after God, and let all the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your ſpirits be in a proportion to that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life that is in you to Chriſt, who is your hope of glory.</p>
            <p>But again, I beſeech you, take heed that you do nothing againſt the life of Chriſt that is in you: It is a ſin for a man to act againſt his life, againſt his natural life, to do that which may ſhorten his
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42593:209"/> life, to do that which may hinder the comfort of life; and if ſo, then what an evil is it to act againſt the life of Chriſt, ſeeing the life of Chriſt is far more excellent than the life of Nature, as you heard before; it coſt Chriſt dear, that life which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to his people, it coſt him his blood, it was not purchaſed without the laying down of his life, and therefore take heed that you do not act againſt him: Let Chriſtians take heed that they do not neglect communion with God; neglecting of communion, and ſleighting of communion, is an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the life of Chriſt in them; for why, the life of Chriſt comes in that way, it is maintained by the ſouls converſing with God, and therefore when a man turns his eye ſo from God, when he is looking downward, continually poring upon the things of this World, neglecting the things of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and does not eye God, and does not converſe with God in all Ordinances and Duties, why this is an obſtructing of the life of Chriſt in you.</p>
            <p>Again, Take heed of giving way to any vanity, take heed of making bonds with ſin, that you do not ſtep out from God in the leaſt, it is deſtructive to the operation of the life of Chriſt, ſin weakens the inward man, as ſickneſſes and diſeaſes do the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; take away the natural ſtrength, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act with that ſtrength as before: ſo it is with ſin, when the ſoul gives way to luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatever they be, he weakens his own ſtrength, he entertains fellowſhip with that which is an enemy to the life of Chriſt in him.</p>
            <p>And then take heed of giving way to ſinful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and unbelief, and dejection of ſpirit, for theſe alſo are great enemies to the life of Chriſt; I ſay, dejection of ſpirit is an enemy to the life of Chriſt,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:42593:209"/> as well as to the life of Nature: therefore reaſon with your paſſions, as ſometimes <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within me?</hi> Know that he hath made you Kings, he hath ſet you upon the Throne that you may judge your own hearts: that holy and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified reaſon may call all your inordinate luſts and paſſions to account in thy ſoul, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> Take heed of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Ordinances, of ſleighting Ordinances, it is by them that the life of Chriſt is maintained and cheriſhed, they are the Pipes, they are the Golden Pipes, though empty in themſelves, yet they are the Pipes through which the Lord is pleaſed to convey life; and therefore the ſleighting of Ordinances, and caſting of them off, muſt needs make way for the hinderance of the life of Chriſt: Chriſtians ſhould take heed, I ſay, in any caſe, that they do not that which may be an obſtruction to the life of Chriſt, to the actings, and to the motion of the life of Chriſt in them.</p>
            <p>Again, To ſay no more, Let all Believers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what matter of conſolation the Lord hath laid up for them in this, in that he hath made Chriſt to be their life; I ſay, what matter of ſtrong conſolation is it in the midſt of all their deaths and dangers, in the midſt of all their miſeries, in the midſt of all their corruptions and enemies, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt about with here in the World? Here is a hidden ground of conſolation: There is a principle of life in them, Chriſt is their principle of Life, and ſuch a principle as ſhall never decay in them, they have ſuch a life as endures for ever; Why, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the midſt of all the want of outward neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; if Chriſtians want, they have a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42593:210"/> life than creatures, and if creatures ſay na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life is better than raiment, then how much more may it be ſaid of ſpiritual life that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than food and raiment, and all outward things below? And ſo in the midſt of all afflictions that do lie upon Gods people at any time, they may comfort themſelves with that hidden life that is within them, though the World ſee not, the world takes no notice of it, the Lord looks upon them as excellent becauſe of that life that is within them: yea, even death it ſelf, the people of God may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves as <hi>Job</hi> did in the thoughts of death, in the apprehenſion of death, though it ſeem never ſo terrible, they have a living Saviour; they who have intereſt in Chriſt, he is a principle of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, and I ſhall ſee him again at the laſt day,</hi> ſaies <hi>Job,</hi> he lives, and he will be life to me, I ſhall ſtand up with him, and I ſhall live in his ſight, this was that which <hi>Job</hi> did ſolace his ſoul in, in the midſt of all thoſe afflictions, in the thoughts of death it ſelf, when it was preſented to him as the King of terrors, yet let the Saints rejoice in this life, for it is ſuch a life as ſhall never be put out, though it be compaſſed about: it is a life that is compaſſed about with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and all that is in a man, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, are enemies to the life of Chriſt; O how many temptations, and how many luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do beſet it round about every day? Well, here is comfort to every one to whom Chriſt is a principle of life, that this life of Chriſt ſhall prevail, and it ſhall continue to ſee all its enemies put under its feet, thou ſhalt live to ſee them all put under thy feet; Chriſt indeed when he came in the fleſh, was perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in his very infancy, he was driven into a ſtrange
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42593:210"/> Country, but he lived to ſee his enemies put under, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 19. the Angel comes and tells <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he may return with ſafety, for they are dead which ſought the young Child's life, to deſtroy him: it ſhall one day be ſaid ſo unto every Believer, to every ſoul that hath intereſt in the life of Chriſt, though for a time they may be perſecuted, and hurryed and driven up and down with the luſts and corruptions of their hearts and this wicked world, yet it ſhall be ſaid one day, <hi>Lo, they are dead which ſought the Childs life.</hi> But ſo much for this time.</p>

            <p>I Have concluded the firſt of theſe Propoſitions, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a Believers life.</hi> But I ſhall proceed to a ſecond Propoſition in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi> I ſhall propound it as exemplary unto all the Saints.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That it is worthy your imitation to converſe with Death at a diſtance; to prepare for Death before Death comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhall find it the practice of the Saints in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: ſo did <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo did <hi>David; Moſes</hi> as you have it recorded in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 12. which is a Pſalm of <hi>Moſes, So teach us to number our daies, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom.</hi> Teach us ſo to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them as we may know our own frailty; ſo as we may have the impreſſions upon our hearts that we
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42593:211"/> are but Graſs, and as the Flower in the Field that withers in a moment; and <hi>David</hi> puts up the like Petition, in <hi>Pſal. 39. 4. Lord make me to know my end, and the meaſure of my daies, what it is, that I may know how frail I am:</hi> Teach me to know my end, <hi>that I may know how frail I am:</hi> He doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know how many daies he ſhall live, or when his end ſhall be, but to know how frail a creature he was, that it may take impreſſion on his heart. And truly theſe teachings are ſuch as none but God can teach, to teach a man to know how frail he is, and every day to look upon himſelf as a Spire of Graſs, or as a Flower in the Field, that is in a withering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying condition every moment. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo tells what his practice was, in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 31. I proteſt by your rejoicing, which I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I die daily.</hi> He died in affection to the World: I fit looſe to the World, I die to it in affection, but I alſo die daily, I put my ſelf into a dying condition, I know that I walk in the midſt of Jeopardies, and therefore I fit looſe from all, yea from life it ſelf, I proteſt I die daily. The Prophet ſpeaks of ſome that put the evil day far from them, it is a ſign that the day of Death is an evil day when men put it far from them; it is a good day to the ſoul that hath intereſt in Chriſt, it is the beſt day that ever came to him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 1. you ſhall ſee what the wiſe man ſays there, <hi>A good name is better than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Oyntment: and the day of death than the day of ones birth:</hi> It is not ſo to every one, but to the righteous it is, to him that hath a good name, a name that is better than precious oyntment; to him that hath the new name better than that of ſons and daughters, to him the day of death is better than the day of his birth; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For to me to die
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42593:212"/> is gain;</hi> and therefore it is good for Chriſtians to look upon death at a diſtance, for death in it ſelf is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>is Death;</hi> it is an enemy, ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as hath a terrible viſage; and therefore let's look death in the face often, that ſo we may be acquainted with the viſage of death, that the terror of this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may be taken away: it is an enemy, and ſuch an enemy as is armed, ſuch an enemy as hath a ſting with him, <hi>The ſting of death is ſin;</hi> and therefore it is a great deal of wiſdom to combate with this enemy at a diſtance, to diſarm him, to take away the ſting before he comes upon you, that you may be the better able to grapple with him when he draws nigh; it is good therefore for men to conſider whether they be able to grapple with and meet this enemy or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be able to look him in the face, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a poſture of combating, and how you may meet with him without fear, how you may overcome him by the blood of the Lamb, to exerciſe faith and to eye the conqueſt that Chriſt hath gotten over death, to ſee how he hath taken away the ſting and horror, and to ſanctifie the Grave, this is a great mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, And therefore let me ſpeak to you one word, you whoſe life is thus to die, do it daily with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: it is exceeding beneficial to the Saints this kind of exerciſe; the Lord himſelf doth commend it as a point of high wiſdom by <hi>Moſes,</hi> O how doth he wiſh his people, that all his people were thus wiſe, in <hi>Deut. 32. 29. O that they were wiſe, that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this, that they would conſider their latter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end:</hi> it is a point of high wiſdom for men to conſider their latter end, and through grace it proves a great help, even unto the people of God, it proves a ſpur to them; I ſay it is a ſpur to the works and ſervices
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42593:212"/> of their Generation, when they conſider their latter end: <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>the night comes when no man can work;</hi> and ſo again ſaies <hi>Solomon, Whatſoever thy hand finds to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor counſel, nor knowledge in the Grave whither thou art going:</hi> If therefore it lieth before thee, neglect not the work of thy Generation; if he ſay, This is the way, walk in it; if he ſay, By this or by that thou ſhalt be for my Glory in the World, take heed you neglect it not, no, not a minute, for how ſoon maiſt thou go to thy home, thy long-home! and there is no work in the Grave; this, through grace I ſay, proves a ſpur to God's people, the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their latter end; I have but a little time in which I can gain glory to God's name, O take it, O ſoul improve it for God's glory; this I ſay puts a man to conſider his latter end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Again, It is that which will make the ſoul truly <hi>Magnanimous,</hi> truly valiant for God, it will beget a mighty Heroick ſpirit, this converſing with death at a diſtance, this conſidering of a mans latter end; ſee what God ſaies in that pathetical wiſh I before ſpake of in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29, 30. If they did but conſider their latter end, how ſhould one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this would make a man Magnanimous for God, it would make a man to carry his life in his hand, and venture it freely if God ſhould call him forth: ſuch a righteous man hath converſed with death at a diſtance, and hath ſeen and knows that it will be gain; he fears not a thouſand, he is truly Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, he only looks at the cauſe, and goes forth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; for though there be a thouſand to one, he fears not, for he hath conſidered his latter end.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42593:213"/> Whereas on the contrary, the neglect of this, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of converſing with death daily, makes men liable to the ſnares and temptations of the world; I ſay, the neglect of this doth expoſe men to a thouſand ſnares in the world: how doth this world keep many from ſeeking after the life of Chriſt? Houſe, Land, Friends, Riches, Honours and Pleaſure, what ſnares are theſe to thouſands? What's the cauſe of this? It is becauſe men do not conſider their latter end, it is becauſe that men have a kind of phancy, or dream that they ſhall alwaies poſſeſs theſe things below: men dream of an Eternity here, and they are not indeed perſwaded of parting, that they are a parting from them, and ſo prove woeful ſnares: they are neglecting the great things of God, and the great things of Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not look upon all as Graſs, as withering Graſs, themſelves alſo as fading Flowers, therefore they are expoſed to theſe temptations; yea, therefore it is that many a poor creature is brought down won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, becauſe they do not converſe with death at a diſtance, they do not conſider their latter end, in <hi>Lam. 1. 9. She remembred not her latter end, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe came down wonderfully;</hi> becauſe men do not converſe with death at a diſtance, they do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their latter end: the rich Fool in the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not his latter end, &amp; therefore he came down wonderfully; men are brought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> down wonderfully, ſuddenly they are cut off e're they are aware of it, and all becauſe they do not converſe with death at a diſtance; and therefore when it comes, it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrange to them, becauſe they do not die daily, they do not conſider their latter end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, there are many that converſe with death, and look death in the face every day, and yet we ſee they are not the better for it: as many that
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42593:213"/> carry their lives in their hands when they go upon the Sea, and ſee the wonders of God in the deeps; and when they go into the high places in the Field, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and venture their lives, ſuch men look death in the face, yet we ſee not that they are the better for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, It is true, there is a converſing with death, which makes not men the better but the worſe: for there are many men, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>It is better to go into the houſe of mourning than into the houſe of feaſting, for in the houſe of mourning the living they will lay it to heart;</hi> but it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men to go ſo long in the houſe of mourning, to be hardened ſo as they cannot lay death to heart, that they look upon it as a matter of cuſtom to die, and to be buried, and there is an end: it is poſſible for ſuch, the Prophet ſpeaks of, who have made a league with Hell and Death; but <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſing with death at a diſtance, was of another ſtamp, for his converſing with death was from an impreſſion that God had made upon his ſpirit of the frailty of the creature, it was the Lord that taught him for to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his daies: till God teach this leſſon, no man can converſe with death daily from an inward real appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the vanity of the creature, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition of this Tabernacle of Clay, this was <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſing. The wicked man converſeth with death, when he is bold to die (as it is poſſible he may) his familiarity with death, it ariſeth it may be from ſome ignorance or hardneſs, he takes his leap, as a blind man may do, when he skips down a Hill; he knows not how far it is to the bottom; through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance men know not what death is, know not what the condition is that death leads to, they do not conſider of the conſequence of it, and of that Eternity that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42593:214"/> follows death, and therefore it is ignorance of this that makes the wicked man deſperate: but when the righteous man is bold as a Lion, and death is familiar to him, it is from a principle of knowledge, and not from ignorance; he knows what death is, he knows that in it ſelf it is an enemy, it is an enemy to nature, and it is deſtructive to all outward comforts, but he knows alſo that death hath loſt his ſting, he knows it is conquered, it is an enemy, but it is a conquered enemy, he knows that Chriſt was the death of it: <hi>O Death, I will be thy death,</hi> it is Chriſt that hath fulfilled and made good that challenge, he knows there is an Eternity beyond the Grave, and can look upon it as gainful, he knows it is gain that is laid up in Heaven, and it is death that makes him ſo gainful, and it is this that makes him ſo bold as a Lion. This leads me more particularly to conſider the Propoſition as it is in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To die is gain.</hi> It is a ſtrange Paradox, that none can reveal but Chriſt, and ſuch as have Chriſt for their life, that death ſhould be gain to: that that ſhould be gain that ſeems to be the greateſt loſs, that ſtrips a man naked of all his comforts, that doth at once take away the deſire of the eye, and the delight of the heart, this is that which a natural man cannot underſtand, or he cannot believe it at leaſt: but it is made good unto all the Saints, and therefore I ſhall lay down this as the Poſition which I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That where Chriſt is Life, there Death is gain.</hi> You ſee there is a connexion betwixt this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Text: and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies (as I told you before) <hi>That the day of Death to the righteous, is better than the day of ones birth;</hi> and ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>We groan to be cloathed upon
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:42593:214"/> with our houſe which is from Heaven, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 4. There is a groaning in all the Saints to be cloathed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that Houſe which is from Heaven, that ſo mortality may be ſwallowed up in life. Now death is gain to every Believer, whether by <hi>Death</hi> you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand leſſer Death, afflictions, loſſes, croſſes, bonds and impriſonments, perſecution; bonds for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as the Apoſte was in; here I ſay, if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>Death</hi> theſe leſſer deaths, it is true, that all theſe deaths are gain, the Lord makes his people gainers by all their loſſes: they gain by every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are brought into; though the outward man loſe, the inward man gains. The Prophet <hi>Habkakuk,</hi> if you look upon him in his great diſtreſs, you ſhall ſee what a gainer he was by it: he was in ſore affliction, he ſaies, his very belly trembled, his very bowels trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled within him, but he was a gainer by this, he gains in faith, his faith broke out gloriouſly, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17, 18. he gained faith, and faith is precious, <hi>The tryal of your faith is more precious than that of Gold;</hi> ſo did <hi>David,</hi> he was in great diſtreſs, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 2. but he was a gainer by it, he gained in faith and confidence, <hi>Though the earth be removed,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and though the Mountains be thrown into the Sea, though the Waves thereof roar,</hi> yet there be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes that <hi>he will hold faſt his confidence in God.</hi> If you look upon <hi>Job,</hi> you ſhall ſee what a gainer he was by all his loſſes, and thoſe ſore afflictions and trials that he met withal, he gained abundance of experience of God, experience of his wiſdom, experience of his power, and experience of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, experience of his goodneſs and kindneſs: he gained the knowledge of God, and he gained the knowledge of himſelf, that when he came out of his affliction, he throws himſelf at the foot-ſtool
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42593:215"/> of God, in <hi>Job 42. 6. Now,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a man of great affliction, there were bonds that did attend him in every place almoſt where he came, yet he was a gainer by all; he gained in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in holy boldneſs, <hi>The Lord hath delivered, and he doth deliver, and he will deliver;</hi> he gained abundance of ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, by contemplation on his condition, and by this he knew how to want as well as how to abound, and he could do all things through Chriſt that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened him, and it was his obedience to the Will of Chriſt which ſtrengthened him; and I believe there is none of Gods people that will bring in their experiences, if they will truly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially caſt up their accounts, but they will and ſhall find that God hath made them gainers by their loſſes, and by their ſeveral afflictions that God hath laid upon them, they have gained at leaſt this, to know that they are nothing, they ſee themſelves what fruitleſs unprofitable creatures they are, and they have known what the creature is when God is at a diſtance, they have ſeen ſomething of themſelves, and ſomething of God, and if there be no more than this, this is a great deal of gain; and that it is true of all theſe <hi>Deaths,</hi> the Lord makes his people gainers by them, and he leads them through theſe conditions, becauſe he intends to make them gainers by them; every affliction that he ſends, is a ſervant of Chriſt, every afflicted condition is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt, and is ſent with a good meſſage, is ſent to communicate ſome good thing to the ſoul of every Believer: God ſtands up and ſaies, as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Who will go and perſwade Ahab?</hi> And the <hi>Spirit</hi> anſwers, <hi>I;</hi> God ſaies, Who will go and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42593:215"/> carry tidings of love from Heaven to ſuch a ſoul, ſomething of himſelf, ſomething of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? God hath ſtore of Meſſengers; That will I, ſaies one mercy: and that will I, ſaies another; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are all ready to communicate ſome good thing to thoſe that love the Lord Chriſt; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are narrow Pipes, all theſe conditions that the Saints are brought into, they are narrow Pipes, they can convey but a little, a very little of God by them; now God is an infinite fountain, and he can convey much of himſelf, one condition is too little, too narrow for God to work in, too narrow a Pipe for God to pour in all that good which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for his ſervants, therefore he chooſeth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of works, great mercies and variety of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are all the ſervants of God, and they have commiſſion to go and work for ſuch a man, to work for ſuch a mans good, the promiſe is given to the Believer, That <hi>all ſhall work together for good,</hi> ſo that all are his ſervants, all deaths, afflictions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, whatſoever diſtreſſes his people ſhall meet withal, ſhall work together for good, they muſt needs gain: a man that hath a multitude of ſervants that work for him, it's all for their good as well as his; why, Believers have a multitude of ſervants, <hi>all is yours;</hi> all, Chriſt is yours, every condition that God hath brought you into, ſhall work for your good, for they are Chriſts ſervants, and you muſt needs be gainers; and truly, God knows that their gain is his gain, he will gain by their gain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will make their deaths to be gain to them, for it comes back again to his Treaſury, he knows that his people will not purſe his glory, will not put up that which is Gods: if God doth come in and make them gainers by their afflictions; if God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42593:216"/> their hearts, and ſet them free, they won't ſay, By my own hand have I made my ſelf rich, by my own induſtry I have gotten this wealth, this ſtrength, this peace, this liberty; for what are we, that we ſhould be able to walk anſwerably to any meaſure that God gives out unto us? But,</p>
            <p>Again, God will make <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf gain unto us, not only leſſer deaths but the <hi>greater death,</hi> it ſhall be gain, even that ſeparation of ſoul from body, which to the wicked man is the worſt of deaths, Chriſt becomes gain to that ſoul whoſe life Chriſt is. I will tell you in one particular (and leave the reſt) wherein death is gain to that ſoul, whoſe life Chriſt is, and that is this:</p>
            <p>He ſhall gain <hi>Reſt: Bleſſed are thoſe that die in the Lord,</hi> in <hi>Rev. 14. 13. Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them:</hi> that's their nature; he ſpeaks in a time of perſecution, when the Beaſt came out of the bottomleſs pit, to make war againſt the Saints, the Lord gives encouragement from hence, they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed though Anti-Chriſt curſe them as Hereticks, but from henceforth they are bleſſed that die in the Lord, eſpecially that die in the Lord as theſe did: but wherein are they bleſſed? In this, <hi>That they reſt from their labours,</hi> there's a part of their bleſſedneſs: ſee what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaies of the righteous man; he ſpeaks of this bleſſedneſs, they ſhall gain reſt, in <hi>Iſa. 57. 1, 2. He ſhall enter into peace: they ſhall reſt in their Beds, each one walking in his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> they ſhall reſt as a man reſts in his bed, ſo ſhall the righteous man reſt in his Grave: the Grave ſhall be as a bed to them, upon which, they that die in the Lord, ſhall reſt ſweetly from theſe their labours; this World is a troubleſome World, a very
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42593:216"/> turmoiling World, full of troubles and labours both to fleſh and ſpirit, and they that die in the Lord reſt from their labours. This World is a place to work in, <hi>When the Sun ariſes, man goes forth to his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour till the evening comes.</hi> But you will ſay,</p>
            <p>This is no great matter, what gain is here? The gain of <hi>Reſt,</hi> reſt to the fleſh, is this any great gain? <hi>Job</hi> ſaies, in <hi>Job 3. 13. For now ſhould I have lien ſtill and been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept; then had I been at reſt.</hi> Wicked men reſt in their Graves, they that could never reſt well but in wickedneſs, they reſt in their Graves; but what then, where is the gain that the righteous man reſts in? For they both reſt in their Graves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is a difference in their reſt, the wicked mans reſt is partial, it is but the reſt of the body, the fleſh only, it is not the reſt of the ſpirit. It is an imperfect reſt, they do not lie down to reſt ſweetly on their beds with thoſe peaceful thoughts that the righteous man hath in his going to bed, to the Grave, O their reſt is a troubleſome reſt; It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. there in the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>My fleſh reſts in hope, and ſhall not ſee corruption;</hi> his very fleſh ſhould reſt in hope, the very fleſh of the righteous man, when it is in the Grave reſts in hope; his very bones when dry and ſcattered, ſtill they reſt in hope, hope of a Reſurrection: But now we may ſay on the contrary, that the very fleſh of the wicked man reſts in fear, his very fleſh reſts in fear, he fears the Reſurrection, that which is the righteous mans hope, is the wicked mans fear, he fears to ſee the morning; he was loth to go to bed, but will be more loth to riſe, for his fleſh reſts in fear; he rather ſaies, Lord let me lie here alway, let me never go out of this Dungeon, better lying here alway than going to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>

But again, Beſides, the reſt of the righteous man is not only the reſt of the fleſh, but the reſt of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> he ceaſes from all the aſſaults of Satan, from his own crooked nature, burdens of ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, whilſt he was in the Land of the living, and thoſe out-cries, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death;</hi> the burden of death and ſin is taken away, it ſhall be put under his feet for ever; he ſhall not ſee any more any of the motions of ſin, any of thoſe luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that formerly did war in any of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he ſhall no more cry, O Lord deliver me from a hard heart, a corrupt ſpirit, a paſſionate heart; O, ſaies he, my life is a burden to me, to ſee theſe daughters of <hi>Heth,</hi> theſe <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becauſe of theſe corruptions of mine, my life is a burden to me. Well, there ſhall be no ſuch complaints beyond the Grave, and therefore, ſaies he, death ſhall make the Saints gainers.</p>
            <p>But again, They ſhall gain freedom from all the <hi>temptations of Satan;</hi> this is great gain, if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they ſhall no more be aſſaulted, no more fiery darts thrown at them: Here they are battered with temptations, that through temptations their lives many times become a burden to them; Ay, but death ſhall ſet them free out of Gun-ſhot; here they are toſſed up and down, turmoiled by Satan, as Chriſt was carryed up to the Mountain, and then to the Pinacle, toſſed up and down from Mountain to Pinacle; Ay, but then there ſhall be no tempter, no temptation ſhall enter any place of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore to the godly man death is gain.</p>
            <p>Beſides, They ſhall gain <hi>freedom from all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and oppreſſions of the World;</hi> I ſay freedom, they ſhall reſt from the oppreſſions of men; and <hi>Job</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:42593:217"/> did account that, and look upon that as a great mercy; he did envy men in their Graves, ſaies he, <hi>They are at reſt: the poor man is freed from the Oppreſſor,</hi> from all perſecutions of men, and from all the ſlaveries and bondages, and tyrannizing of them; why, death ſhall ſet them free from the oppreſſions of men, from all evil of men, from all wars, and rumours of wars, and ſad effects of wars, death ſets them free from theſe. O, ſay you, I have loſt a friend, but you know not what he gained, he is taken from the evil to come in the Generations after him; he ſhall reſt from all ſorrows, from all afflictions, from all paſſions: the Lord God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, there ſhall be no mourning beyond the Grave, no complaining in the ſtreets of the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, Lay all theſe together, and ſee if this be not gain to thoſe in whom the life of Chriſt is: to gain nothing but this; <hi>Reſt</hi> from their labours, and reſt from oppreſſion and tyranny, to reſt from ſorrows, paſſions, tears and mournings, this is a mercy; but to reſt from temptations, to reſt from ſin, and from all thoſe luſts and corruptions that did war in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and in their minds, this is a great mercy, if there were no more; ſee how you are beholding to Chriſt for theſe, if you find no more gain that death brings you in that are in Chriſt, how are you beholding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt for it? Death is not gain in it ſelf, but you are beholding to Chriſt that hath made it ſo. It is ſaid of <hi>Noah</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 29. when <hi>Noah</hi> was born, it is ſaid, this ſame ſhall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands; <hi>This man ſhall comfort us, for he ſhall be a Preacher of righteouſneſs,</hi> he was a Type of Chriſt, and a Preacher of righteouſneſs through faith, and therefore <hi>Noah</hi> did comfort them through Preaching of Chriſt the righteouſneſs of Faith, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:42593:218"/> of reſt, a place to take up in, in the midſt of their toil and labour; they were beholding to Chriſt, o whom <hi>Noah</hi> was a Type, who is this reſt: and to you death would not be thus gain, if Chriſt had not made it ſo; no, this man, this Lord Jeſus hath brought in comfort concerning that eſtate of ſeparation of ſoul from body; it is not gain in it ſelf, but Chriſt hath made it ſo unto his people. O how are you engaged unto Chriſt! ſay even for this, if you ſhould hear no more of this reſt, I will bleſs his great name for it.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle, I told you the laſt day, doth converſe with Death at a diſtance. But I entered into the main Point, which I ſhall proſecute at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is Gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>Where Chriſt is life, there death is gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See the Connexion, <hi>For to me to live is Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt is my life, and death is my gain: Death is gain to that ſoul that hath Chriſt for its life. One particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I named, I ſhall proſecute the reſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Their gain is a gain of reſt; I ſay, every Believer by death gains <hi>Reſt,</hi> a reſt from toil and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of an evil turmoiling World; <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labour,</hi> they reſt the reſt of the righteous man: When he is in the Grave, it is another kind of reſt than the reſt of the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:42593:219"/> wicked; it is ſaid of <hi>David</hi> who is a Type of Chriſt that <hi>his fleſh reſts in hope:</hi> the fleſh of the righteous man reſts in hope, but the fleſh of the wicked man may be ſaid to reſt in fear, he may fear the approaching day of light, he may fear to lie down, but more to riſe up; he cries out, O Lord, let me lie here to Eternity, for the chains of darkneſs are better than the light of a new day; but the fleſh of the righteous man ſhall reſt in hope, he ſhall have no more fiery darts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thrown at him, he reſts from temptation and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the World, and from the tyranny of man, he reſts from all griefs, ſorrows, tears and complaints, where all tears ſhall be wiped away, and no complaints in the ſtreets at that day: here is a great deal of gain, the righteous man gains reſt in the day of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, As he gains reſt, ſo he gains <hi>perfect peace, and fulneſs of joy;</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa. 57. 1. The righteous are taken away from the evil to come,</hi> &amp;c. and it is ſaid, he ſhall enter into peace, <hi>They ſhall reſt in their beds, every one walking in his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs;</hi> they ſhall not only reſt in their bed, in the Grave, but they ſhall <hi>enter into peace,</hi> and they ſhall enter into joy, in <hi>Matth. 25. 21. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord:</hi> he enters into peace, he enters into joy, that he ſhall thenceforth dwell in it; he ſhall dwell in joy, he takes full poſſeſſion of it, it is no more ſhut out: peace doth enter into the righteous mans heart whilſt he is on earth, but till death comes, his peace here ſhall be interrupted, he ſhall enter into it, and it into him; what <hi>Job</hi> ſaies of the body, ſo of the joy of the righteous man, it continues not at a ſtay, his peace and joy is many times interrupted, but in Heaven he ſhall meet with no more Clouds, there ſhall be a morning that ſhall drive away all Clouds, he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into joy, and he ſhall dwell in the fulneſs of it;
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42593:219"/> Chriſt hath purchaſed it, and he hath given out the firſt fruits of this peace and joy, but the full poſſeſſion is no till death, and therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal. 97. 11. That light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart:</hi> he reaps ſomething here, but it is but a little in reſpect of the harveſt that he ſhall reap afterward, it rather ſeems to be a ſowing time than a reaping here, but afterward he ſhall reap the fulneſs of it; peace is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart: ſo that here is another benefit of gain to a Believer by death, he ſhall then drink to ſatisfaction of thoſe Rivers of joy and pleaſures for evermore that do run at the right-hand of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But again, Thirdly, As he gains joy and peace, ſo by death the believing ſoul <hi>gains enlargement and liberty;</hi> this is a great part of his gain: the ſoul by death is ſet at liberty; for the ſpirit even of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, though it be the Candle of the Lord, and though it be enlightened from Heaven, yet whilſt it is in this body, which is now corrupted, it is like a light that is in a dark Lanthorn, the light of thoſe excellent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul are eclipſed and darkened; I ſay, ſo it is with all mankind, the curſe came by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that the body is as a dark Lanthorn to the ſoul, and it doth hide that light which ſhould otherwiſe be revealed; as the ſoul acts moſt highly when it hath leaſt of the body, as when the body is aſleep, it ſees not, it hears not, it reads not, yet the ſoul then ſees, and mourns, and joyes more exquiſitely than it doth or can do in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and therefore when the ſoul is nigh parting with the body, it acts moſt highly, and ſo it ſhall do in its ſeparation, when ſeparated from his body, it ſhall be freed from his dark Lanthorn, it ſhall be taken out from his Dungeon, as it were, and all the faculties of the ſoul ſhall be enlarged, the underſtanding, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42593:220"/> the capacity of the ſoul ſhall be mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. The Prophet ſpeaks of a time a coming, that there ſhall be no more an Infant of daies, the beginnings of it ſhall be on earth but the perfection of it ſhall be in Heaven, <hi>There ſhall be no more an infant of daies, there ſhall be no more a child of underſtanding, but he that is weak ſhall be as David, and he that is as David, ſhall be as the Angel of the Lord;</hi> the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſoul ſhall be wonderfully enlarged, as it ſhall comprehend moſt of God; here it is ſtraitened, and it could not receive much of God, it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much of the myſteries of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, it is not large enough to take in much of the notion of thoſe glorious things, but when death comes, it ſhall be enlarged: <hi>And then,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſhall know, even as I am known.</hi> It ſhall be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged to take in very much of God. And as the underſtanding ſhall be ſet at liberty, ſo all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul ſhall be ſet at liberty. They ſhall be greatly enlarged towards God, and run towards God, the deſires of the ſoul ſhall run like a mighty ſtream to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; here there was but a little drop of the affection, but then a mighty ſtream ſhall run; not only faith but love ſhall be perfect.</p>
            <p>A believing ſoul ſhall be enlarged in reſpect of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the faculties, ſo all the actings of the Soul, ſhall be ſet at large, at liberty: here the ſoul can't act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its deſires, it would do more for God, but there's a clogg that lies upon it, it hath mighty wings, wings like the Oſtridge, but there is ſuch a heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it can't get up: there's wings would carry the ſoul up to Heaven every moment, but there is a heavy body; in <hi>Rom. 7. 19, 20, 24. For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42593:220"/> that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> I ſay there is infiniteneſs in a believers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to do for God, and he would enjoy more and more ſtill, and he would do more and more for God, ay, but he is ſtraitened up in his actings, there he is narrow, he cannot act according to his deſire: but now when death comes, the believing ſoul ſhall be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, it ſhall be able to act according to its deſire, it ſhall be whatever it deſires to be, and it ſhall do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it deſires to do, and it ſhall have as much holineſs as it will deſire to have; this is a mighty priviledge, and a great deal of that gain that comes in by death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſoul where Chriſt is its life; it meets with this liberty and enlargement. But again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The believing ſoul by death gains not only liberty but <hi>abundance of life:</hi> it gains life, it hath more of the life of Chriſt, it enjoyes more of the life of Chriſt, and hath the fulneſs of it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; and now Brethren, this is a mighty gain to gain life: what would a man gain more, and what is a greater gain than life? It is beyond the gain of all treaſure whatever. Natural life is the greateſt of all mercies; <hi>Thou ſhalt have thy life for a prey,</hi> and that's the greateſt mercy, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> and in this the believing ſoul ſhall come nearer to the life of Chriſt, for he ſhall have the life of Chriſt, who is the fountain, and ſo more of it communicated to him; and therefore it was that, for which the Apoſtle deſired to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all, for there he ſhould have perfection of life in Chriſt, there ſhall be nothing there to hinder the life of Chriſt from flowing in unto the ſoul, there ſhall be no cloggs, no rubs in the way, but there ſhall be a full enjoyment, and a full
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42593:221"/> manifeſtation of that life of Chriſt, which is the life of the ſoul, is made over to the ſoul for its life even to Eternity; this is another part of the great gain that comes in by death to believing ſouls. But again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, As it gains life, ſo it gains <hi>victory by death;</hi> the believing ſoul gains Victory, full, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory and conqueſt over all its enemies: He doth not only reſt, as I ſaid before; it is a great gain to reſt, reſt from the motion of ſin, and luſt, and reſt from the motion of temptation, but that's not all; it reſts and ſits down as a Conquerour, the Palm of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is then put into the hand of every Believer, and he ſhall ſtand upon that Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſhall ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> unto the Lord, he is then made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour there, for all enemies at that day are put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; all the luſts of his heart, and all Principalities and Powers, and whatſoever was a vexation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietment, ſhall be put under his feet, and he ſhall ſit down with Chriſt as a Conquerour, <hi>I have fought the good ſight</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8. I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith, and now is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs:</hi> my life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, it was my time of combating, but now I am ready to be diſſolved, to be offered up, I ſhall ſit down as a Conquerour, and I ſhall have a Crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that's another priviledge, another part of the gain that comes in to the believing ſoul by death. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, <hi>It gains a full ſight of God:</hi> I ſay, the believing ſoul by death gains a full ſight of God, a full viſion of God; this gain is glorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable: it's that which the Saints do preſs after to ſee the face of God; it was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s great requeſt, <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy face;</hi> mighty deſirous to ſee the face of God: and indeed it is a compleating of their
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42593:221"/> happineſs that they ſhall ſee the face of God; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. here is the bleſſedneſs of that people whoſe heart is purged by faith, they ſhall ſee God; they ſhall ſee him here, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, but in Heaven they ſhall ſee him face to face, in 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 12. We now ſee him through a glaſs darkly, but we ſhall ſee him face to face, and then ſhall we know him as we are known:</hi> It is true, God cannot be ſeen with the eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, neither here nor in Heaven, ſo the Saints cannot ſee him, for he is an infinite Being, a Spirit inviſible, inviſible to the eye of the body, but he ſhall be held forth clearly, God will hold himſelf forth to the eye of their underſtanding, and his people ſhall have full and clear viſions of him: they ſhall know him in his Nature, and they ſhall know him in his attributes, they ſhall know him in all his works, and they ſhall know him in his Word; whatſoever was hid from them in the daies of their fleſh, ſhall then be revealed, they ſhall know him in his Counſel, in thoſe ſecret waies which God walked in from Eternity, which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can give a reaſon of, God will then unfold himſelf, they ſhall have continual viſions of God, viſions of grace, and viſions of love, and viſions of light, and viſions of glory, which ſhall continually flow forth from the Throne, this will be a mighty gain. When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſee his Houſe, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 7. ſhe ſaid, <hi>Happy are thy ſervants that ſtand in thy preſence, to hear thy wiſdom;</hi> if they were happy that ſaw <hi>Solomon</hi> and his wiſdom, and look'd him in the face, then much more ſhall they that ſtand for ever in the preſence of the great God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and ſhall ſee his face and behold his wiſdom, and ſhall for evermore be ſatisfied with a full viſion of God, ſo much as the creature can hold.
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42593:222"/> It's true, the creature is finite, it ſhall not be infinite as God himſelf is, but they ſhall behold the glorious viſions of God himſelf, which will be mighty gain. But again,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seventhly, Believing ſouls by death ſhall be gainers in reſpect of their habitation: here they dwell <hi>in a houſe of Clay,</hi> ſo <hi>Job</hi> calls it, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 19. it is a <hi>houſe of Clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, and is cruſh'd before the Moth.</hi> It is a poor houſe that a Moth can throw down, that the Moth can cruſh, and yet this is the houſe, the houſe of the body, and this is the houſe that the ſoul lives in whilſt it is here; a houſe of Clay that hath no foundation but the duſt: a houſe without a foundation, it cannot ſtand, it's down in an inſtant, every ſtorm of wind will blow it down, it hath only its foundation of, and from the duſt; exceeding frail is the body ſet forth by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: now what ſhall the ſoul gain when death comes, <hi>It hath a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands eternal in the Heavens:</hi> It's a manſion, or dwelling houſe, it's not a Tabernacle; <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions, Job.</hi> 14. 2. It's not made by the hand of man, it's made by God himſelf: It's glory that was laid up before the foundation of the world; it's uncreated glory, God himſelf will be the heaven, he'll be the dwelling place of his people, and they ſhall dwell in him, throughout all Generations for ever and for ever: here is a change you ſee, in reſpect of the habitation, and it will be much more gain, than for man to change a Dungeon for a Palace, the ſoul comes out of a Dungeon, and it's put into an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, an Inheritance with the Saints in light. But Again,</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:42593:222"/>8. Eighthly, They gain in <hi>reſpect of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> our Saviour ſaies in <hi>Matth. 8. 11. They ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of God;</hi> no worſe company than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect: there ſhall be no failings, nor defects, there ſhall be no want of love, there ſhall be no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to take off love, but they ſhall enjoy the company of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, this will be a mighty gain. Here there are many failings, failings in the beſt of Saints, the beſt company that believers have, even Saints, there are failings in the beſt of them; but there ſhall be nothing ſeen there, but the Image of God, nothing but the Image of Chriſt; when they look upon one another, they ſhall ſee nothing but an attractive love, there ſhall be no emulation there, they ſhall not envy one anothers glory, but every one ſhall glory in his own happineſs as his own gain: they ſhall gain in reſpect of company. Again in the</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninth place, They ſhall gain <hi>Confirmation and Eſtabliſhment</hi> by this bleſſed condition, all this that is ſpoken of, he ſhall be eſtabliſhed in it for ever: there ſhall be no more returning to ſin and ſorrow, no more returns of former temptations, there ſhall be no more poſſibility to fall again, but it ſhall be confirmed and eſtabliſhed in bleſſedneſs, it ſhall no more loſe his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than Chriſt can loſe his, no more turned out of heaven than the Son of God can be turned out, they ſhall be confirmed and eſtabliſhed for ever, there ſhall be no robbers, nor no fear of danger; this is another part of their gain.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Tenthly, To name no more, Believers ſhall be gainers <hi>in reſpect of their body;</hi> for their <hi>bodies ſhall be new moulded at the Reſurrection of the great day,</hi> the body ſhall be made new and ſerviceable to the ſoul,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:42593:223"/> every way fitted and Organized for the ſoul to work: <hi>This corruptible ſhall put on incorruption,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, and <hi>mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up in life;</hi> God will make up theſe veſſels of the bodies of his people again at the Reſurrection, and when he hath raiſed them up, he will raiſe them as veſſels of honour, and veſſels of glory. And as it is ſaid, that that matter whereof is made the pureſt <hi>China,</hi> is buried many Generations in the earth before they take it, and of that they make the pureſt <hi>China<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo though you be buried in the earth, the Lord will raiſe you up, though many Generations after, and they ſhall be raiſed up, and fitted for the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified both in ſoul and body to Eternity. This is the gain of that ſoul by death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to that body whoſe life Chriſt is: And there muſt needs be gain to thoſe that are Chriſts. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, It were not poſſible that Believers ſhould be willing to part, and leave all comforts behind them, and that they ſhould ſo part with all willingly, with that which is ſo deſirable in the world, I ſay, it could not be, if there were not gain behind: for Gods people have nature as well as others, and they have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affections, and nature ſeeks its own preſervation, and it looks upon death as an enemy, and yet that this enemy ſhall be entertained ſo willingly, that when the Lord calls, he ſhould open his boſom to receive the ſtroke that he ſhall ſend; and be a volunteer in his death; certainly there is ſomething in this, there is that which the World knows not of: how willingly did Chriſt ſend forth his ſpirit? It's ſaid, <hi>He cryed with a loud voice, and gave up the Ghoſt,</hi> his ſpirit was not ſnatcht away violently, but he gave it up wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; it is not ſo with the wicked man, and it was not ſo with the rich fool in the Goſpel, <hi>This night ſhall thy ſoul
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:42593:223"/> be required at thy hand;</hi> his ſoul was commanded, it was taken from him by force and violence, whether he will or no, he was not a volunteer, but his ſoul was pluckt from him; but that a man ſhall give his life up voluntarily, that he ſhould entertain death voluntarily, and part with all friends, Wife and Parents; why, ſurely it is becauſe the Lord gives a greater aſſurance of gain, which is to be found beyond death it ſelf. But again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, If there were not ſuch gain by death to the godly man, it were not poſſible that he ſhould make ſuch a venture as he doth. If a man venture into a far Country, he will not venture for a little, he will venture for gain, and good gain, or elſe he will not venture: there is a venture at death with the godly man, he makes a venture, and it is the greateſt venture that ever was made, he doth not venture his eſtate, but he ventures his ſoul which is infinitely of more worth than his eſtate, and the venture is for Eternity, and if that venture be loſt, all is loſt, and he is undone for ever, yet thus he ventures and lancheth forth into the Gulph of Eternity: but he hath a word from the Lord, and he ſaith, Well, if God will deceive me, let him, I will venture; now the believing ſoul doth ſee the future great gain that will follow death. But again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, If it were not ſo, Believers were the miſerableſt creatures of all men; <hi>If it were not for Chriſt, we were of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> if there were no hopes of better, then we were the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of all men, for we are the loweſt of all men: Afflictions, Perſecutions, Griefs and Sorrows of all ſorts is the portion, many times, of Gods deareſt people and children; now if there were nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, <hi>we were of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> the Apoſtle was in deaths often, he was dead every
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:42593:224"/> way, he carried his life in his hand, he was the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the world, ſo accounted, and now if there were in this life no hope, no hope of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, no hopes of a better world, then we were miſerable indeed; but the believing ſoul knows that the end of the righteous man is peace, and the end of the tranſgreſſour is, to be cut off. But again,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly and laſtly, to name no more, Death muſt needs be gain to believing ſouls, becauſe it was gain to Chriſt: Chriſts gain came in by death, and therefore ſo ſhall theirs: <hi>Ought not the Son of man to ſuffer theſe things, and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi> It's the way to his glory, by way of ſufferings. He was led along all his life in this way, his gain came in by loſſes, his honour, his greateſt honour came in by diſhonour, and that reproach and that low condition that befell him whilſt he was in the World, he found honour in diſhonour, and his exaltation came in in a way of humiliation, and life came in for all his people in a way of death, by his own death, <hi>He took upon himſelf the form of a ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came in in a way of humiliation, and life for his people came in by his death; as it was with Chriſt, ſo ſhall it be with his members; for there ſhall be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and there ſhall be an uniformity betwixt Chriſt and them; as it was in the head, ſo ſhall it be with the members; as his exaltation came in in a way of humiliation, ſo ſhall theirs, and their life in the greateſt of it ſhall come in by death; God the Father delights to walk in this way, for it is contrary to the World, and God delights alway to do the greateſt things by contraries. In the Creation of the World, and ſo in the new Creation, when he made the World he made all things of nothing: and ſo of the new Creation, he converts a ſinner by that which is moſt
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42593:224"/> oppoſite, by the Word of the Lord, which his ſoul hates, and yet that Word of the Lord doth conquer him, and change him into his own likeneſs: and ſo God leads his people to glory through a low way of ſuffering, and when he brings them to the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, he carries them through the dark entry, through the dark narrow ſtrait entry of death, and through that place he leads them to the enjoyment of that glory which comes in by death. I have no time for Application: But Brethren conſider it, death is gain to thoſe whoſe life Chriſt is, but it is loſs, and the greateſt loſs that ever was met with, unto thoſe that have not Chriſt for their life; I beſeech you to look to your ſelves, and to look about you before death comes: when death comes you muſt venture ſuch a venture as never was made, you venture your ſouls and your Eternity, and by that venture you are made or elſe you are marr'd to Eternity; look about you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, Is death like to prove gain to you or no? What aſſurance have you that death ſhall be gain? I ſhould preſs this further, but the time is paſt already, I ſhall reſerve it for another time.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PHILIP. 1. 21.</bibl> For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain:</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOU may remember the Point that we are inſiſting upon.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That where Chriſt is life, there death is gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have opened the Point, and ſhewed you wherein death is gain to believers in ſeveral particulars. But I ſhall proceed in anſwering ſome Objections before I come to the Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be, may ſome carnal heart ſay with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> how can theſe things be? how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that death ſhould be gain, when it ſtrips a man of all his comforts, turns him out of poſſeſſion of Houſe and Land, it is no longer his, if death comes it deprives him of all his friends, he is left friendleſs, it turns him naked out of the World, and how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that that ſhould be gain?</p>
            <pb n="462" facs="tcp:42593:225"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, If there be not ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, if a man hath not an Inheritance laid up in Heaven, I grant it, that death is the greateſt loſs of all, for it robs a man of all comforts at once; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, if a man hath not a ſhare in the Land of Promiſe, if he hath not a more endurable ſubſtance in Heaven, I grant that death is a great loſs; therefore what I ſay concerning thoſe who are gainers by death, it concerns them only that have intereſt in Chriſt, and to them it is not loſs to be ſtript of all comforts; for why? It puts them into poſſeſſion of their Inheritance; and what though death doth ſtrip them of a few outward comforts? It's no great loſs, or it's not conſiderable. If a great Heir be gone home to his own Country, if he gets to his own door, his own houſe, and his purſe be taken from him, what are a few pence? It's no great wrong, becauſe he hath now taken poſſeſſion of an Inheritance that will bring him in a yearly Revenue, thouſands it may be; the loſs of his few pence from his purſe is no great matter.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Beſides, Whatſoever is loſt in death, it is no great matter to a gracious heart, becauſe the World is Crucified to him, and he to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand; I ſay, however the World may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death as a loſs, yet a gracious heart doth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World is dead to him before-hand, and if it be dead, if it be a dead Carkaſs, it is no great loſs to part with it; and though a man loves his Friend ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dearly, as <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe was the beloved of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Abraham</hi>'s beloved wife, and yet when death came, <hi>Give me a burying place,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that I may bury my dead out of my ſight,</hi> it was no matter to be parted with, when ſhe was dead; and ſo ſaies a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart of all the things of the World, they are
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:42593:226"/> dead, <hi>The world is crucified to me,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>and I to the World,</hi> and therefore no great loſs to him to part with them, becauſe they are dead to him.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Beſides, A believing ſoul ſhall find all to be made up in God abundantly; whatſoever ſeems to be a loſs ſhall be made up in Heaven, with the preſence of God and Chriſt: Is there a loſs of houſe and Land? The Lord will be the dwelling place of his people throughout all Generations; doſt thou loſe the light of the Sun? the Lamb is the light of that City: thou ſhalt find all relations in God, Husband, Wife, Brother, Siſter, whatever relation is broken by death, it ſhall be made up in God, he ſhall be their friend inſtead of all, and you ſhall find the comfort of all relations made up in Heaven; in <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will be a God to thee:</hi> it comprehends all relations, that is, Friends, Father, Husband, Wife, Houſe, Land, all creature comforts whatſoever: <hi>I will be a God to thee,</hi> they are to be found in God. Therefore whatſoever, I ſay, ſeems to be loſt by death, ſhall be made up in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God himſelf, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: ſo much in anſwer to that. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Some poor hearts that are taken with this truth, and with the great gain of Heaven, will try out, O Lord, why do I live in this miſerable world? and why is light given to him that is in miſery? and why is life given to the bitter in Spirit? <hi>Job</hi> 3. 20. I have heard of the gain of death, and I cannot be content any longer in this vale of miſery, to be kept from my gain, I know not how to bear it any longer: O that the Lord would make haſte, and let looſe his hand upon me, and cut off this thread of my life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now good Chriſtian, let me ſay a little to thee; do not make too much haſt, do not make more haſt than thy Father would have thee. I remember the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:42593:226"/> Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26. ſaies, <hi>Be angry and ſin not;</hi> ſo ſay I to thee, deſire death but ſin not in thy deſire: every deſire of death, is not a good and a warrantable deſire; there is a holy deſire of death, and there is a ſinful deſire of death, and have a care thou ſinneſt not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay then, How far may a man deſire death? When are his deſires holy, and when are they ſinful? This is a Caſe of Conſcience, that is very obvious and obnoxious to moſt of Gods people at one time or other, and therefore I ſhall ſpend ſome time in anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you when a mans deſires of death are ſinful. And ſecondly, When they are holy and good.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, Deſires of death are <hi>Sinful,</hi> when a man ſhall act any thing againſt his own life: I ſay, when a creature ſhall act any thing againſt his own life, when a man or woman ſhall do any thing that ſhall ſhorten their own daies, or when they ſhall refuſe the comfort that God hath given, or helps to prolong life: if a mans hand be found againſt his own life, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſinful and wicked deſire of death. There's great evil in this, let me ſhew you the evil. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, It <hi>doth pluck that out of Gods hand, which God hath challenged as his right: the iſſues of life and death they belong to the Lord;</hi> my times are in thy hand, ſaies <hi>David;</hi> now it is wicked boldneſs for a man to pluck times out of Gods hand; when a man will have them in his own hand, and not that God ſhould have the diſpoſal of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Beſides, There is this evil in it, <hi>A man caſts away the moſt precious Jewel, when he acts againſt his own life;</hi> he caſts away the moſt precious Jewel in nature: Life is the preciouſeſt of all natural gifts; Life is a Talent, a great Talent, it is a Talent
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:42593:227"/> given thee for to improve it for God, not to waſte it away; God gives thee this Talent, that it may be laid out for him, that thy life may be laid out for his name and glory, and not to caſt it away at thy own pleaſure, or diſpleaſure: know therefore, that if any man ſhall at any time act any thing againſt his own life, God will call him to account for it; if the wicked ſervant was condemned, becauſe he did not improve his Talent, what ſhall become of him that threw away his Talent? Life is precious; when a man ſhall act any thing againſt his own life, it proceeds from ſinful deſires of death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Again, Deſires of death are ſinful, <hi>When a man ſhall deſire to die, before he knows what it is to live or to die;</hi> when a man deſires to die, before he hath begun to live, or before he knows what it is to die. There is many a poor creature will be ſpeaking againſt his life: O that my life were at an end; O that God would take me out of the World: But haſt thou begun to live yet to God? Many a poor creature will ſpeak againſt his own life before he knows what God hath done for him: haſt thou done the work God hath ſent thee into the World for? Haſt thou glorified his name on earth? Haſt thou finiſhed thy courſe? Haſt thou conſidered theſe things before thou deſireſt to die? Doſt thou know what it is to die? Haſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that death is a door that opens to Eternity? It opens to an Eternal condition, to a place whence there is no return: Haſt thou conſidered what door death will open to thee, whether to the inheritance of the Saints in light, or to an inheritance with the wicked in utter darkneſs? If thou haſt not well conſidered of theſe things before thou deſireſt to die, then theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of death are ſinful deſires: No, rather go firſt to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:42593:227"/> God, and deſire him to teach thee to live. It may be thou haſt been twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years in the fleſh, haſt thou begun to live? haſt thou made him the end of all thy ſervices? doſt thou bring forth fruit to him, and not to thy ſelf? is it he that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens thee and carries thee out to all thy duties and ſervices? is Chriſt thy life? Thou hadſt need know what it is to live: deſire that God would teach thee, what is the end he ſent thee into the World for, the cauſe of thy coming, rather that thou maiſt know how to live, and when to die, that when death comes it may be gain, for if thou doſt deſire death before, thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are ſinful.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, Fourthly, Deſires of death are ſinful, <hi>When a man deſires death in a paſſion:</hi> It is a failing that is incident unto Gods own people, and therefore you had need take heed of it: It was <hi>Jonah</hi>'s fault, and alſo <hi>Elias</hi> failing, in <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 3. ſaies he, <hi>Take away my life, it is better for me to die than to live;</hi> and when <hi>Jonah</hi> ſpake this, he was in a great paſſion: ſaies God in Verſe 9. <hi>Doſt thou well to be angry? I do well to be angry even unto the death.</hi> Was <hi>Jonah</hi> fit to die now? to die in an anger, to die in a paſſion? Certainly if at any time, <hi>Jonah</hi> was now unfit to die. It was a ſtrange paſſion he was now in, and at this time he was angry with God himſelf, and yet this man will needs die; did he know what he ſaid? O, paſſion, paſſion is blind and unreaſonable; he will go to God, he will go to the Throne of God, to dwell with God for ever, when he is angry with him, he is angry with the grace and mercy of God, in <hi>Jonah 4. 2, 3. For I know that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil: Therefore now, O Lord, take I beſeech thee, my life from me, for it is better for me to die
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42593:228"/> than to live.</hi> Certainly <hi>Jonah</hi> was now unfit to die, to go to God, whenas there were ſuch contrary diſtempers prevailed in his ſpirit, ſuch a diſtemper as was moſt contrary to God; God was full of love, full of bowels and pity, full of meekneſs, patience, compaſſion, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and quietneſs of mind: contrary to all this, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> muſt and would needs die; here's a paſſion which is a ſinful deſire of death; and ſo <hi>Elijah</hi> in 1 <hi>Kings 19. 4. But he himſelf went a daies Journey in the Wilderneſs, and came and ſat down under a Juniper tree: and he requeſted for himſelf that he might die; and ſaid, It is enough now, O Lord, take away my life: for I am no better than my Fathers; Jonah</hi> will die in a paſſion of anger; <hi>Elijah</hi> would die in a paſſion of fear: he was afraid of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> afraid that ſhe ſhould cut him off, but it was his failing; what was <hi>Elijah</hi> loth to be made a Martyr? would he die? and is he loth to die in Gods cauſe? to die for the truth? why, would <hi>Elijah</hi> die, yet afraid that God won't ſupport him, and uphold him in his way? This is his infirmity, like unto thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s; therefore, Brethren, take heed of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fears, and <hi>Jonah</hi>'s paſſion. It is common, if they meet with any diſcontent, O then that God would take away my life, O that I were out of the world; thus to deſire to die when in paſſion, thou art leaſt fit to die; and therefore it is a ſinful deſire. That's a Third. Again,</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, Deſires of death are ſinful when a man ſhall deſire to die, <hi>only to gain eaſe to the Fleſh,</hi> to be rid of ſome troubles or afflictions that lay upon him: When a man ſaies, O I lye under a heavy burden, and I know not how to get rid of it, O that God would make an end of my daies, for I ſee if ſuch or ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes upon me, I know not how to bear it when it comes; O that God would take away my life before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:42593:228"/> this is a deſire of the fleſh, which is a ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. I will ſhew you the ſinfulneſs of it, when a man deſires to die only upon theſe grounds, to be rid of trouble and affliction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, He doth charge God fooliſhly: It is ſaid of <hi>Job</hi> in the latter end of the firſt Chapter, <hi>In all this he ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Job</hi> did charge God, when he came to conſider the day of his birth, he ſpake againſt his own life, <hi>Wherefore is light given to him that is in miſery, and life given to the bitter in ſoul?</hi> There <hi>Job</hi> did charge God fooliſhly, as if God were not wiſe enough to meaſure out thy portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O thou wouldſt die that thou maiſt be eaſed of ſuch and ſuch an affliction, thou chargeſt God with want of faithfulneſs, want of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, want of love: ſee what <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid when he flattered with the people, <hi>O that I were Judge,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I would hear every mans Cauſe, and it ſhould not be ſo and ſo, I would rule better than my Father David;</hi> he charged his Government with folly, I would do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice better than he. And truly ſo thou ſaieſt, O that I were in Gods place, O that I ſat upon the Throne, I would diſpoſe better of my own condition, I would diſpoſe of it with more wiſdom, and more love, and more compaſſion. What a high charge is this to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God! O, have a care thou doſt not charge God; thou ſaiſt, wherefore is life given to thee in ſuch an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? thou chargeſt God fooliſhly: Doſt thou not know? why God knows (it may be) that the life of Nature is continued, that ſo he may increaſe the life of grace in thee, or that he may kill the life of ſin in thee, or that he may give thee more of himſelf, that thou maiſt have more experience of his love and goodneſs, or that thou maiſt be a pattern to others, a pattern of his patience, of his power and goodneſs, and therefore is life given thee.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:42593:229"/>2. Secondly, Nay further, When thou ſpeakeſt againſt thy own life, and deſireſt to die, thou doſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and commit that ſin which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, they tempted God, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When thou ſaiſt, O that God would take away thy life, that thy affliction may may be taken away; why, cannot God take away thy affliction, and not take away thy life? hath God no other way? He can make a hundred doors, and find out a thouſand waies; muſt he needs open that door, the ſtrait door of death, or elſe he cannot open a door of deliverance for thee? why doſt thou limit and tempt the holy one of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> If thou deſireſt death becauſe thou wouldſt be delivered, thy deſire is ſinful. O deſire rather that the Lord would be with thee in thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make thee a Conquerour over thy affliction, that thou maiſt get above thy affliction to glorifie God in the fire. That's a Fourth. But,</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, Thy deſires of death are ſinful, <hi>When as thy deſires are unlimited,</hi> when they are not ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Will of God, when they are abſolute, when a man will have no denial whether God ſee it good or no, whether the Lords time be come or no; thou ſaiſt it is gain, ſhall I not deſire gain? No, thou maiſt not deſire gain with an immoderate deſire. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> reproves thoſe that ſay, We will go, and buy, and ſell, and get gain, no, but ſaies he, <hi>Stay and ask God leave, If God will, we will do ſo and ſo,</hi> &amp;c. When you would go to the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for gain in that City, ſay not, <hi>We will go, we will go;</hi> no, ſay, If God will let me go: God will have thee to finiſh thy courſe; there are many that would go, though the Lord hath no need of them; theſe unlimited deſires of death, are unlawful deſires.</p>
            <pb n="471" facs="tcp:42593:229"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, When are deſires of death Lawful? I ſhall deſire to ſpeak a few words to that briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt of all, When a man doth not deſire death for death, <hi>but death for life.</hi> There are many poor creatures are deſirous to die, but they know not wherefore, but now a holy man hath holy deſires, his deſires are not death for death, but death for life: for death is an enemy; to deſire death, only to ceaſe to be, only to lie ſtill in the Grave and ceaſe to be; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> tells you wherefore he deſired death, he don't deſire to be uncloathed, <hi>But to be cloathed upon, that mortality may be ſwallowed up in life; not to be uncloathed,</hi> to lay aſide the body, to be in the Grave, and to ceaſe from being, but <hi>to be ſwallowed up in life, to be cloathed upon,</hi> to deſire death for life: ſeek for that life which we are ſure ſhall come into us by death, this is a lawful deſire.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Deſires of death are lawful when a man deſires to die, <hi>that he may ſin no more againſt God,</hi> that corruption may be fully mortified, that there may be nothing left in the ſoul to provoke the Lord any longer, that may diſpleaſe the eye of his glory, that it may be holy in all things, made like unto Chriſt, even without ſin: a gracious heart ſaies and believes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath ſpoken it, that death ſhall be the death of ſin, as well as the death of the body, ſin brought death into the world, and death ſhall carry ſin quite away, that at death it ſhall be aboliſhed, that there ſhall be no more ſenſe of ſin, no ſenſe of luſt; to deſire death for this end, that the creature may ſin no more, that God may be diſpleaſed no more, and grieved no more, this is a lawful deſire.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, When a man deſires death, that he may enjoy communion with Chriſt, this is lawful, to enjoy
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42593:230"/> full communion with Chriſt, that was the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>Phil. 1. 23. Having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt which is far better;</hi> wherefore doth he deſire to be diſſolved? he tells you, <hi>To be with Chriſt,</hi> to ſee the face of Chriſt, to enjoy the preſence of Chriſt, that he may be filled with the love of Chriſt, and behold the glory of Chriſt, and may be for ever in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, and never look off his face, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy full and perfect communion with Chriſt: to deſire death for theſe ends is lawful.</p>
            <p>4. Again, Fourthly, When a man deſires death, <hi>That he may lift up the name of God in Heaven, that he may do the Will of God perfectly, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Saints and Angels.</hi> O here he cometh ſhort in all the works and ſervices he deſires to do, he cannot do the thouſandth part of that which he deſires to do, and therefore deſires death, that he may lift up the name of God fully in Heaven, that he may there be ſwallowed up in the preſent enjoyment of God and Chriſt, that he may be infinitely enlarged to ſing <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs</hi> unto God to all Eternity; thus to deſire death is lawful. But,</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly and laſtly, to ſay no more, <hi>This deſire of death muſt be with an indifferency to the Will of God:</hi> though it be for never ſuch good ends, though a man deſires death for lifes ſake, though he deſire death that he may ſin no more, that he may be with Chriſt, that he may lift up the name of God fully in Heaven; yet if it be not with an indifferency to the Will of God, it is not a holy and lawful deſire: and therefore the Apoſtle in the Text, refers himſelf to the Will of God, <hi>I am in a ſtrait, I know not what to do: it is beſt for me to die, I am in a ſtrait, I will not determine:</hi> though I ſhall be deprived of my gain, and be a loſerby it, yet it is no great matter, if God may gain any thing by
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:42593:230"/> my life, if his Church may gain any thing, if any poor ſoul may gain any thing, if God hath any further work for me, I am content to live, <hi>I know not what to chooſe,</hi> ſaies he, but I refer my ſelf to God, this makes the deſires of death lawful. When a man hath conſidered all, and yet notwithſtanding he knows death ſhall be gain to him, yet he refers himſelf ſtill to the Will of God. If thou haſt any ſervice which may be for the good of thy people, and for the advancement of thy name, if thou haſt any meſſage, though it is hard to keep from home, if the Lord will have me do any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for him, why, I am willing. When the deſires of death are thus referred to the Will of God, ſubmitting to his Will, whether by life or death; thus are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of death holy and lawful. Thus have I ſhown you when deſires of death are ſinful, and when lawful. The Application of the Point is yet behind.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PHILIP. 1. 21.</bibl> For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Subject in hand is Gain, and therefore I hope you that are wiſe Merchants will not be weary of it: the whole World is for gain; every man ſaies, Who will ſhew us any good? I have ſhewed you a great deal of gain that is by death, for thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt: and O that the Lord would make your hearts deſirous to know how you ſhall get this gain, how you may ſo live as that the great venture you make of death may be gain unto you. But I ſhall proſecute that in its time. You may remember the laſt day we ſpent moſt of the time in Anſwering a Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Whether it be lawful to deſire death or no? I told you there is a good deſire, and there is a ſinful deſire of death, and I ſhewed you the differences. But I ſhall wave repetition, and come to the Application of the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It lets us ſee what a fancy or conceit that is that men have taken up, That the ſoul hath no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence without the body, but that it ceaſes to be, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42593:231"/> the body is laid in the duſt: there is ſuch a conceit that the ſoul ſleeps, or that it ceaſes to be until the day of Reſurrection, that God ſhould give life again to the body.</p>
            <p>This Text doth confute that opinion; though it may be matter of temptation, even to Gods own people: if it were ſo, then it ſhould not be gain to die, if the ſoul ceaſe to be, when ſeparated from the body, it ſhould not be gain to die. I might bring many places to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this: what think you of that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. where Chriſt ſaies unto the good Thief, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> ſurely Chriſt ſpeaks not of the body, it could not be underſtood of the Grave that his body ſhould reſt in, for to be with Chriſt in Paradiſe implies more: Paradiſe was a place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it was a place in which <hi>Adam</hi> did enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: therefore certainly the ſoul hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence when ſeparated from the body, the ſouls of the righteous are where they do enjoy the preſence of God. Again, that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. where it is ſaid of them that are under the Altar, they cryed out, <hi>How long Lord, holy and true, will it be, e're thou avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> Then the ſoul hath exiſtence when it is out of the body, for theſe ſouls cryed, <hi>How long Lord?</hi> It is true, there are divers operations of the ſoul which do ceaſe, which do depend upon the operation of the body; but there are many operations in the ſoul which the ſoul doth moſt excellently exerciſe, notwithſtanding its ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the body: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in a holy, ecſtaſie as out of the body, and when he was in the body it's ſaid, <hi>His ſoul ſaw ſuch things as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable,</hi> not to be ſeen nor heard. But I ſhall not need to go any further to ſtrengthen you againſt this temptation; the Apoſtle in this Chapter ſaith, <hi>I am
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42593:232"/> in a ſtrait between two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> Where you may ſee, firſt, That the ſoul when it is ſeparated from the body, it doth not ceaſe to be, for it is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: <hi>I deſire to depart,</hi> an active expreſſion; ſome Tranſlate it, to flinch, or move, to remove from one houſe to another; or to be looſed, or diſſolved, ſo ſome Tranſlate it: I deſire to be ſet free from this my priſon; my ſoul is in priſon while I am in the body, now I deſire to depart from this houſe, to be fetch'd from this houſe, to depart from, this Priſon, and to be with Chriſt, to depart and to be with Chriſt: ſo then there is a being with Chriſt in a ſtate of diſſolution, for the Apoſtle doth deſire to be diſſolved for this very end, that when he was diſſolved, he might be with Chriſt; there is a being with Chriſt, there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Chriſt in a ſtate of diſſolution. Nay, he ſaith, <hi>It is far better:</hi> he knew that he ſhould enjoy more of Chriſt when he was gone, he ſhould have more intimate communion with the Lord Jeſus in a ſtate of ſeparation, than when he was in the body, that condition was far better; now I ſay, if the ſoul do ſleep, if it ceaſes to be, or to act or to enjoy Chriſt, when it is ſeparated from the body till the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; why, then he could not have ſaid, it is far better to die, and to be with Chriſt. But it may be ſaid, it is better to die, becauſe death frees from the miſeries of life, and ſo the Apoſtle might ſay, It is better to die, becauſe death frees from the miſeries of life, becauſe there is a reſt and a ceſſation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent troubles and turmoils in the world. If there had been nothing elſe, he could not have ſaid, It is better to die; for I ſay, to live, to live the moſt afflicted life, and the moſt troubleſom life in the world is better than to die, and to ceaſe to be, if there be not an enjoyment
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42593:232"/> of life after that departure. Yea, it had been better for the Apoſtle to have lived, if there had been no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the ſoul, for then all knowledge of God and of Chriſt ceaſe, and no actings for God, no lifting up of the name of God, it had been better for him to have lived to have been ſerviceable to God in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to have lived to have known Chriſt, for all knowledge of God, upon that ſuppoſition, is to be loſt and gone; to reſt thus, his gain is no better than the beaſts gain, the very beaſts gain reſt to the fleſh: If there had been no more gain by death, he could not have ſaid, It had been better to die than to live; and to live, it had been far better than to die and reſt, if there had not been a further enjoyment of God in Chriſt, in that eſtate of ſeparation and diſſolution. And therefore I beſeech you that you would hold this faſt, that you may be ſtrengthened againſt this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that there is no enjoyment of God and Chriſt in a ſtate of ſeparation, when the ſoul is looſened from the body: though it is true, the full enjoyment, the full revelation of heaven is not until the Reſurrection, when ſoul and body ſhall both enjoy the glory of heaven. But ſo much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, If death be gain where Chriſt is life: then this may comfort you in the loſs of your friends, you ſhould not mourn inordinately for the loſs of your friends, when you have hopes of their death. It is true, it is not only lawful, but it is a duty to mourn. I ſhall ſhew you how far it is lawful to mourn in the loſs of friends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, As ſeeing that the hand of God is gone out againſt you: If the Lord comes and makes any breach in a Family, and the hand of God is gone out againſt you, the Lord would that men ſhould lay it to heart, in <hi>Heb. 12. 5. My ſon deſpiſe not the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:42593:233"/> chaſtening of the Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked:</hi> there are two great extreams, either to deſpiſe the chaſtening of the Lord, or elſe to faint under it; the Lord would that we ſhould lay his hand to heart when it is upon us; to conſider what is the voice of the Rod, what is the meſſage that is in its mouth, and what it is that the Lord ſpeaks by ſuch and ſuch an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Our mourning ought to be either more or leſs according as thoſe that we part with are more or leſs uſeful and ſerviceable in their Generation; when God plucks away thoſe that are Pillars, thoſe that ſhould ſtand in the gap, thoſe that ſhould prevent Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhould hold his hand from ſtriking a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in ſuch a caſe the Lord allows, nay, he calls for a great deal of ſorrow: and it is made a ſign of a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted people, and a people that are fit for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and nigh to ruine, when the Lord ſhall take away ſuch Inſtruments, and it is not laid to heart, in <hi>Iſa. 57. 1. The righteous periſh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>no man lay it to heart, none conſidereth that they are taken away from the evil to come;</hi> It is a ſign that there was evil a coming to that people, when the righteous are taken away, and they do not lay it to heart. But I ſay, when that we have no hopes in the death of Friends, when we ſee the hand of the Lord is gone out to cut off men in ſin, when God ſhall meet them in a way of rebellion, I confeſs there is more cauſe of raking up a ſad lamentation. You know what was <hi>David</hi>'s car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in this caſe, when God ſmote his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he was ſmitten in his rebellion, he died in his ſin, and therefore <hi>David</hi> takes up a ſad lamentation, <hi>O Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, my ſon, my ſon, would God I had died for thee;</hi> but in another caſe, in the caſe of another Child, when his Child died, in whoſe death he had hopes, <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:42593:233"/> did not mourn with bitterneſs then, he rather was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: ſeeing it is the Will of God, <hi>I ſhall go to him,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>he ſhall not return to me.</hi> Thus you ſee how far it is lawful to mourn, whenas God takes away a friend by death; but when we have hopes in their death, that death is gain unto them, this ſhould exceedingly compoſe and calm and quiet our ſpirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, Your loſs is great, your loſs is exceeding great, ſuch a dear Husband, ſuch a loving Wife, ſuch a beloved Child, there's none knowe how great my loſs is, and therefore do not condemn me in my mourning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, How dear ſo ever thy friend, and how great ſo ever thy loſs be, if thou haſt intereſt in Chriſt, thy loſs cannot undo thee; if the Lord be thy portion, thy loſs cannot undo thee: <hi>Baruch</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved becauſe he took up ſo ſad a lamentation in <hi>Iſa. 45. 3. Woe is me, for the Lord hath added grief to my ſorrow, I fainted in my ſighing, and I find no reſt: woe is me,</hi> &amp;c. he had intereſt in God, and therefore he did not well ſo to complain, becauſe his loſs could not un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do him; yea, thy loſs is not ſo great but God can make it up in himſelf, and if God give thee more of himſelf, though leſs of the creature, thou ſhalt have no cauſe to complain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, But again, Conſider, and look upon not only thy loſs, but look upon the gain of thy friend: if thou haſt hopes in his death, look upon his gain, and let that quiet thy ſpirit; why, he gains reſt, he is laid down to ſleep, will you mourn when your friends lie down in their beds to ſleep? The righteous when death comes, it laies them upon their beds to ſleep; if thy friend gain reſt, why then ſhouldſt thou diſquiet thy ſelf by inordinate mourning? He gains peace and joy: the righteous enter into peace, and therefore
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42593:234"/> why ſhouldſt thou ſo mourn, as to diſturb thy peace, or to quench and damp the joy of the Lord in thee? Why, it is thy friend that dies in the Lord, it is the time of his advancement, he is advanced, it is his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-day, or a day of Coronation, and therefore there is no cauſe of inordinate mourning. And you that are Parents, that love your Children never ſo dearly, you will be willing to part with them for their preferment, though you marry them, when it may be you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy little of them, when they ſhall go hundreds of Miles from you, you ſhall enjoy little of them; But you will ſay, it is to a man that hath a great Eſtate, and why ſhould I hinder them? Now are you willing to part with your Children for preferment when you ſee they may enjoy a little of earth, and ſhall you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with them, when they may enjoy the fulneſs of Heaven? Will you truſt a man, a creature with them, and will not you truſt the Lord with them, who hath more right to them than you, and hath more bowels towards them, and more power to do them good, infinitely more than you? Why, you are willing to part with your friends for their ſafety; if dangers are coming, you are content that your friends ſhould be hidden in places of ſafety, and ſhall you mourn, if the Lord ſhall take your friends to hide them? for if God do take away the righteous, it is but to hide them, he will hide them from the evils to come, he will take them and hold them in the Grave, that they ſhall not ſee the evil that is coming, he will hide them till all calamities be paſt and gone, and they ſhall then come again in the time of the Reſurrection. <hi>If you love me,</hi> ſaies Chriſt, <hi>you would rejoice becauſe I ſay I go to the Father:</hi> Do you love your friends, and will you mourn inordinately becauſe they go to their Father, when they go to lie in the boſom of their Father?</p>
            <pb n="481" facs="tcp:42593:234"/>
            <p>But you will ſay, Did not Chriſt weep when <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was dead? Chriſt wept and mourned. It is lawful to mourn, I told you before, and how far you may mourn; But it is conceived, our Lord did no mourn nor weep ſo much becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> was de at as becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to live again; our friend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> ſleepeth: Chriſt did not weep becauſe of that, Chriſt knew what he intended to do, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould be raiſed again, therefore he did not weep for the loſs of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but rather he wept that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was coming into a troubleſome World, for he knew that his friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould be a loſer by it, though <hi>Lazarus</hi> was content that Chriſt might be glorified to come again; even as Chriſt was content to leave the glory of Heaven to do his Father ſervice. Chriſt knew <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould be a loſer, and therefore he was very loth to awake him, to ſtir him; his friend was now lain down to ſleep, and ſhall he awake him before the morning? Therefore was it that Chriſt wept. Still, I ſay, retain this as a ground of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in the parting with your friends, when ever you have hopes in their death, know that it is a time of their advancement, and therefore whilſt you have your friends; do all the good to them you can, and get all the good from them you can, ſo that that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of yours may not be a burden to you, and be a gaul to you in the loſs of friends, but when God ſhall call for them, when you have hopes in their death, do not grieve inordinately, but know and reſt in this, and rejoice in it that it is their gain, and their greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. So much for the ſecond Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let this ſtir up every one to be inquiſitive, how death ſhall be made gain to them; I ſay, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſeek after this, it is a point of as great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as you have met with, and therefore you ſhould
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:42593:235"/> ſpend many thoughts upon it; how ſhall you know, and how ſhall you get aſſurance of this, That when death comes it ſhall be gain unto you? Let me ſtir you up to ſeek after this, to get the knowledge and aſſurance of it. Why Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, That you cannot withſtand the ſtroke of death, you had need make haſt in this work, I ſay, you cannot out-ſtand the ſtroke of death when it comes; the ſtroke is unavoidable. Poor man! he is cruſh'd before the very Moth, there is a decree, and an appointment of God concerning it, and therefore it cannot be withſtood. O how little do men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves in the thoughts of this? That man doth not only die, becauſe he is made of duſt, and ſo muſt return to duſt, all creatures muſt be diſſolved into their principle; but he dies by his Statute Law, he dies by the decree and appointment of God, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by way of puniſhment, and this ſtill makes it more certain: <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death, which was appointed for all men once to die; there is no man can redeem his ſoul from going down to the Grave;</hi> what man is it that lives and ſhall not ſee death? It is every one of your conditions, every fool that is here: and therefore what need of looking out to get aſſurance that death ſhall be gain!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Nay let me tell you further, that you may make the more haſt in this work, This time is like to be a time of great Mortality, Judgements will ſweep away many, Plagues ſhall be poured out upon the World, till the World be reconciled to God and his Truth; and now in this latter time, there ſhall be greater oppoſition than ever, and ſo greater Plagues than ever; now that Chriſt is making way for his Kingdom, he will bear down thouſands before him. Look to your ſelves, you had need get aſſurance that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42593:235"/> death ſhall be gain: <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: bleſſed are they that truſt in him;</hi> bleſſed are they that know death is gain; I tell you Chriſt ſhall go forth in a great deal of wrath now to ſmite and bring down his enemies to make his way to his Kingdom; and certainly the appearances of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glorious, and terrible to the World; in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16, 17. ſee how terrible Chriſts coming ſhall be, which certainly is at hand! even the Kings and Counſellours, and the great men in the World ſhall cry; when the appearances of the wrath of God do come even amongſt the Saints, what flinching ſhall there be of great men, to be hid from the wrath of the Lamb? Still this calls upon us to get aſſurance that death ſhall be gain. Nay, let me tell you, that many of Gods own people may be born down in the brunt, for Anti-Chriſt will coſt ſomething in his fall; as he coſt a great deal in his riſe, ſo he falls by violence, and by the ſword, and it is poſſible his fall may cruſh many of Gods own people.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me propound this to your Conſideration, That it is the greateſt adventure that ever ſoul can make, this of death; and let that be another ſpur to you where death ſhall be gain: you do not venture your Eſtate, but you venture your ſouls, and a greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be made; it is the venture of the ſoul, and it is a venture made for Eternity; that, that can be but once done, had need be well done: It is appointed for all men <hi>once</hi> to die, and but <hi>once,</hi> they cannot die it over again, they had need learn to die well when death comes, that you that are Believers may truſt God in the venture, you may ſhut your eyes and follow God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when as God led him forth from his Kindred, from his Fathers houſe, he follows God no man knows whither: and ſo muſt you do when death
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:42593:236"/> comes, ſhut your eyes, and believe, and venture, and follow God whither he will lead you, though from your Kindred, and from your Fathers houſe to a Land you know not: and therefore before death comes, your eyes had need be opened. Look about you and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly of the venture that you make of death, and how it is that you ſhall be able to go through. What is it that ſhall carry you through this venture? you had need take a great deal of pains in ſearching after this, you had need learn to get aſſurance that death ſhall be gain, how elſe ſhall you be carried through this venture?</p>
            <p>And let me tell you, It is ſtrange to conſider that rational men that have rational ſouls, ſhould be no more moved in ſuch a point as this is; when a man ſhall know that it is appointed for him to die, and that in death he doth make an adventure, the greateſt venture that he can make, he ventures for Eternity, the greateſt venture that ever was, and yet whilſt it is high time, that he doth make no more inquiſition after the knowledge of this one thing, that death might be his gain. And let me ſpeak a word to you who are in Chriſt, that I may preſs it upon you. Labour to get the knowledge of this, that death may be your gain; you that do walk in the dark, and at uncertainties concerning this, you that fear the Lord and have given up your names to him, and now walk in the dark, and at uncertainties, and know not whether death ſhall be your gain; No, my Brethren, this is a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, next to the condition of the unregenerate, this is the ſaddeſt; O that the Lord would cauſe you to wait upon him till he clear up this truth to you; why, how mightily are your ſpirits diſinabled! the want of the knowledge of this, that death ſhall be gain, it keeps you in bonds; in <hi>Heb. 2. 14. Who through fear of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:42593:236"/> death, were all their life-time ſubject to bondage:</hi> you are kept all your life-long in bondage, <hi>through the fear of death,</hi> becauſe you know not whether it will be your gain or no; O it is a ſad condition that Gods own people ſhould be all their life-long ſubject to bondage. Nay, if you have not this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that death ſhall be made gain, your ſpirits will be weak and feeble, it will weaken your hands and knees, and make you unable to do for God; the want of this knowledge will make a Chriſtian to walk baſely and cowardly, it will make him ſervile, and make him ſlaviſh in what he doth for God, and make him fearful to ſtand for God, and to hold up the name of God in evil times, and in ſuffering times, it will make a man be baſe, and betray his truſt, the want of this knowledge will make a Chriſtian betray his truſt, it will make him deny Chriſt and his truth many times, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when he was preſſed with this fear.</p>
            <p>And therefore to ſay no more, As you deſire to have your ſpirits raiſed mightily for God, and for the ſervice of your Generation; would you do great things for God, (and truly God hath great things to do for his people, even in theſe laſt and latter daies, even ſuch things as eyes have not ſeen, nor ears heard, God will work in theſe latter daies, and his people ſhall be his Inſtruments.) What ſhall raiſe up your ſpirits, make them noble and ſuitable to the great work and enterprizes that God hath now in hand? If any thing in the World will do it, it is this, the knowledge and aſſurance that death cannot hurt you, when it comes nigh: death ſhall be an advantage to you, you ſhall find gain in death, and whatſoever you ſhall loſe, you ſhall find it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely made up in God; the knowledge of this
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42593:237"/> that death ſhall be gain, it heightens your ſpirits, and raiſes up your ſpirits in the great things of God, in the ſervice of your Generation. But you will ſay, How ſhall we come by this knowledge, by the aſſurance of this, that death ſhall be gain? It is a great Queſtion which will take up much time, therefore I ſhall not enter into it. So much for this time.</p>

            <p>You had need look about you betimes, there is a time a coming when you muſt make ſuch a venture as you never made in all your lives; you Ship all that you have, and all that you can carry with you for another world: when death comes, there is ſuch a venture as never was made in reſpect of the diſtance of place, you do not venture to the <hi>Indies,</hi> but you venture to another world, a world which we had known nothing of, if the Lord had not pleaſed to give us a glimpſe of it in his Word, for elſe we ſhould have known nothing of it; you venture more than all your Eſtates: for, my friends, you venture your ſouls; the ſoul that is more worth than all you have in the World, if you were Maſters of the whole world: <hi>What! will a man venture for the gain of the World, to loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Your loſs is irrecoverable, there is no hopes of any future trading, for you venture once for all, ſor it is for ever.</p>
            <p>And herefore, I beſeech you, Conſider what need you have of looking to this venture, and to get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it ſhall be made a gainful venture to you.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, What directions will you give us, that we may have aſſurance of gain in this venture? I ſhall ſpeak but one word to you.</p>
            <p>Seek after an intereſt in Chriſt, get Chriſt to be your life, and then you ſhall be aſſured that death ſhall be gain: I will not give you any other direction, I will not ſet you any other way, it will but lead you about; and alas, poor ſouls, you had not need be led about, you know not how ſoon the Wind and Tide may ſerve, and you may ſet Sail for Eternity. And therefore again, I ſay, ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt, get him to be your life: If death ſhall find you whilſt you live to the World, and live in your ſelves, whilſt you live upon your works, upon your righteouſneſs,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:42593:238"/> upon your riches, upon the creature; I ſay, if death ſhall find you before Chriſt be your life, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it ſhould be gain: know that there is none can give you aſſurance but only Chriſt, there is none can aſſure the commodity that you Ship for Eternity, but only Chriſt, he is the Maſter of that Inſuring Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and there is none can aſſure the ſoul but only he; I tell you, the venture that you make, is more worth than all the world, it would break the whole World to make good the loſs of the ſoul, and yet not able to effect it; Chriſt ſits in the Inſuring Office, and he only can give you aſſurance that death ſhall be gain, and therefore go and wait upon the Lord for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt: Chriſt is made over to poor ſinners in the promiſe of free grace, and when Chriſt is given, all other promiſes are given with him, and if Chriſt be given with them, then this promiſe is true, that death ſhall be made gain to you: go and wait at the foot-ſtool of grace, and ſay, Lord, give out one word, one promiſe, and that ſhall be my aſſurance for my venture for Eternity; do not reſt till you get Chriſt into the Ship, till you get Chriſt into the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to venture with you; when Chriſt comes once into the ſoul, he will be a good Pilot, he will carry you through all ſtraits and difficulties, he will ſave you in the midſt of all ſtorms you ſhall meet with in your paſſage to Eternity, he will rebuke the wind and the waves, though the Ship were ready to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd: he can ſtop every leak, he will throw out every thing that is burdenſom unto the Ship; then death lightens, and out goes ſin, and out goes ſelf; <hi>Micah 7. 19. And thou wilt caſt all their iniquities into the depth of the Sea.</hi> Well then, go to the Lord and ſay, O Lord, the time is a coming when I muſt make a venture; I muſt venture my ſoul, I muſt
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:42593:239"/> venture for eternity and to another world, and I would fain have my Goods inſured before hazard comes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhoot the Gulph; give me a word of promiſe from thy ſelf, and I ſhall reſt upon it, if thou wilt come into the Ship, if thou wilt be my Pilot, I know then that all ſhall be ſafe, and I ſhall not only meet with ſafety, but I ſhall make the moſt gainful voyage that ever was made; I ſay, get Chriſt to be your life, O reſt not till Chriſt have Inſured you that all ſhall be ſafe: this is the only way to make death gain. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I ſhall ſpeak to ſuch as have intereſt in Chriſt, and yet do walk in the dark, and ſtill are as if they walked in the region and ſhadow of death; they have choſen the Lord for their portion, and they have cleaved to him, and yet are not able to ſay that death will be gain to them. I beſeech you labour to get your hearts fortified, and your ſouls ſtrengthened againſt the fears of death, O how unuſeful will you be until that be done? What bondage are your ſpirits in through fear of death till that be done? How low are your ſpirits, how unſuitable unto Gods glorious diſpenſations until that be done? Therefore look unto the Lord this day to ſtrengthen your ſelves againſt the fears of death. What ſhall ſtrengthen you, you will ſay, how ſhall our ſpirits be fortified againſt theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinful fears of death?</p>
            <p>1. Firſt of all, Labour to underſtand clearly what is the nature of the Covenant of Grace; I ſay, labour to underſtand clearly the nature of the Covenant of Grace, what that Covenant is by which now God ſaves his Children, and brings all his Sons unto glory: The ignorance of this keeps Chriſtians in bondage through fear of death; know therefore, that the way of ſalvation now, it is by a Covenant of free Grace, God engages for all, and it is even of free promiſe,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:42593:239"/> I will pardon, and I will ſave, and I will ſanctifie, I will give ſalvation, and I will give faith to apprehend that ſalvation; <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8. By Grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> there is an abundance of the Covenant of Grace in theſe words, <hi>You are ſaved by grace, through Faith;</hi> Ay, <hi>But that Faith is not of your ſelves, but it is the gift of God:</hi> know that all is given out freely unto poor creatures under the Goſpel; and that all that God requires to be done, it is not to make any purchaſe of Love, or Grace, or Heaven, there is no ſacrifice or oblation to be offered any more: <hi>Chriſt hath offered himſelf a ſacrifice once for all,</hi> and there needs no more oblation, no more ſin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but that all the ſacrifices of the Saints now under the Goſpel, are ſacrifices of thankſgiving only; it is only to render unto the Lord for what he hath done, for what he hath given out freely by Jeſus Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

Brethren, labour to know the freeneſs of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this and the like particular, it will be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preparatory to thee to die well, and to fortifie thy ſelf againſt deaths approaches, <hi>viz.</hi> the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Covenant; it is ſaid in <hi>Heb. 2. 15. That when Chriſt came, he delivered them who through fear of death, were all their life-time ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;</hi> In the Goſpel men are delivered from the fear of death, becauſe that the Goſpel doth clearly unfold the Covenant of grace. Before the coming of Chriſt they were trained up in a more legal way, they did not fee the clearneſs of the Covenant until Chriſt came, and therefore till Chriſt came they were in bondage through fear of death; but when the Goſpel was once given out, and where that comes, it dtoh unfold Gods Covenant, the Covenant of his Grace in the freeneſs of it, which doth mightily fortifie and ſtrengthen the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:42593:240"/> hearts of his people againſt fears of death; and truly, ſo long as any of Gods people do act legally in their ſpirits, I ſay, though they be under a Covenant of Grace, yet if they act legally in their ſervices, not clearly underſtanding the Covenant they are under, it is not poſſible that they ſhould meet with perfect peace, or be ſtrengthened to this venture of death with freedom of ſoul without abundance of fear: <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee,</hi> Iſai 6. 3. becauſe he truſteth in thee; when the ſoul truſts only in God, when it reſts only in the Word of God as a foundation of the Covenant of Grace, then it reſts in peace; but when the ſoul doth act legally, and thinks he ſhall purchaſe ſomething by his actings, O how unquiet and legal will thoſe ſervices be to him? When he works for life, how will he know he hath wrought enough? If he ſtaies himſelf on his own righteouſneſs, and not on the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, there will be miſ-givings of heart, and no perfect peace; Ay, but is this righteouſneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat? Have I done enough? But are not my works defiled? Is not my righteouſneſs ſpotted? or is it not ſhort? or is it not ſcant? doth it not want ſomething of length and breadth? will it wholly cover my nakedneſs? Thus the ſoul doth queſtion with it ſelf when it is looking after the Covenant of Grace, and thus the ſoul is carried out to act in the Covenant, and to look upon all as purchaſed by Chriſt, there is the mighty foundation laid, free-grace and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; the ſoul may even venture upon it when it walks through the Valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death; that is the firſt Direction. I beſeech you labour to underſtand the nature of the Covenant of Grace by which he brings his people to glory. But again,</p>

Secondly, As you deſire your hearts ſhould be fitted againſt the fears of death, look up to the Lord to inable you to live by Faith; whileſt you look up, learn to live by Faith; to live by Faith is the way to die in Faith, and the more Faith the leſs fear, the leſs carnal fear: and therefore, O look up unto the Lord to help you to live by Faith, to exerciſe Faith in every condition; it is ſaid, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Here you may converſe with death:</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, In the death of Chriſt, and then with your death, which is approaching: Chriſtians, Behold your own death in the death of Chriſt, look upon a dying and a bleeding Saviour, behold him as dead, and laid in the Grave, and what was the end of all this, but <hi>that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, and deliver his poor people from fear of death?</hi> Behold Chriſt as a mighty Conquerour by Faith every day, and ſee death conquered: and know that when Chriſt conquered, he conquered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, he conquered death not only for himſelf but for his people; O Chriſtians, if you were wiſe to make improvement of the death of Chriſt, how might your ſpirits be ſtrengthened againſt fears of death?

O ſtand and wonder: death is not gain in it ſelf, it is the greateſt loſs in the World; Ay, but this man ſhall comfort us concerning the toil of our hands: this man comforts, this Lord Jeſus comforts concerning
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42593:244"/> death as he makes it to be gain; that which ſeparates ſoul from body, which might have ſeparated ſoul from God to Eternity, ſhall not only ſeparate ſoul from body, but ſet it nearer unto God and Chriſt, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he ſoul into ſweet injoyment of himſelf, it leaves the body in the Grave to refine it, and God will at the laſt day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Be you willing to ſuffer any thing for him, for his ſake: you may well do it, he hath made death to be gain to you; you may well labour, there is a <hi>Reſt</hi> for you: Be you willing to do and ſuffer for Chriſt. Nay, you ſhould lay out your lives for Chriſt, O put them off at the beſt advantage, to die for Chriſt is the beſt advantage, O, put off life for the beſt gain for Chriſt: you may well do it, for he hath made death exceeding gainful and advantagious to you.

            <p>What ſtrong Conſolation doth this miniſter unto you? O, bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe; Chriſt to be gain, Chriſt to be advantage in life and death? There is a bleſſed condition, why, all you that have intereſt in Chriſt, what need you fear death? I ſay, what need you fear death? It cannot hurt you, it is an enemy diſarmed, the ſting is taken out: you may take a Waſp in your hand and put it into your boſom when the ſting is out; the ſting of death is out, and it cannot ſeparate you from the love of your Father.</p>

            <p>But you will ſay, Do not Gods own people fear death, even as well as others? Why, we ſee they are ſubject to fears; where is the difference betwixt their death and others? they may have fears of death as well as other men.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It is true, even the righteous man may fear; nay, not only the fear of nature, but his fear may be ſometime inordinate and ſinful; Ay, but in his fear he runs to the promiſe, even as <hi>Jacob</hi> did when he was greatly diſtreſſed when he came to his brother, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I fear my Brother,</hi> but he runs to the Promiſe, <hi>but Lord, thou haſt ſaid, thou wilt be with me, and do me good and bleſs me;</hi> he fears as well as others, but in his fears he runs to the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Yea moreover, To ſay no more but this, The righteous man ſhall be delivered from all his fears; therefore he does not upbraid the righteous, they have Promiſes to run unto, and the Lord their God will ſave them from their fears: even our Lord Jeſus feared when death approached, he was greatly afraid, he put up ſtrong cries with tears and groans, and yet was heard in that he feared, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:42593:245"/> In the daies of his fleſh he feared, and his fears made him cry aloud, and his Father that was able to ſave him, is able to ſave thee from all thy fears: theſe fears ſhall make him cry to his God, and he ſhall be certainly heard in that he feared, and ſo was made a Conquerour: And ſo ſhall it be with thoſe that are in Chriſt, they ſhall be Conquerours over all their fears; this poor man cried, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
